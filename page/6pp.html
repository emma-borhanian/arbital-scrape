<p>This post discusses the following claims:</p>
<ol>
<li>[claim([6tm])]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>The world is locked right now in a <a href="http://www.existential-risk.org/">deadly</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Superintelligence.html?id=7_H8AwAAQBAJ">puzzle</a>, and needs something like a miracle of good thought if it is to have the survival odds one might wish the world to have.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>[claim([6tn])]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>Despite all priors and appearances, our little community (the
  "aspiring rationality" community; the "effective altruist" project;
  efforts to create an existential win; etc.) has a shot at seriously
  helping with this puzzle.  This sounds like hubris, but it is at this
  point at least partially a matter of track record. %%note: By track
  record, I have in mind most obviously that AI risk is now relatively
  credible and mainstream, and that this seems to have been due largely
  to (the direct + indirect effects of) Eliezer, Nick Bostrom, and
  others who were poking around the general aspiring rationality and
  effective altruist space in 2008 or so, with significant help from the
  extended communities that eventually grew up around this space.  More
  controversially, it seems to me that this set of people has probably
  (though not indubitably) helped with locating specific angles of
  traction around these problems that are worth pursuing; with locating
  other angles on existential risk; and with locating techniques for
  forecasting/prediction (e.g., there seems to be similarity between the
  techniques already being practiced in this community, and those Philip
  Tetlock documented as working). %%</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>[claim([6tq])]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>To aid in solving this puzzle, we must probably find a way to think
  together, accumulatively. We need to think about technical problems in
  AI safety, but also about the full surrounding context -- everything
  to do with understanding what the heck kind of a place the world is,
  such that that kind of place may contain cheat codes and trap doors
  toward achieving an existential win. We probably also need to think
  about "ways of thinking" -- both the individual thinking skills, and
  the community conversational norms, that can cause our puzzle-solving
  to work better. %%note: Again, it may seem somewhat hubristic to claim
  that that a relatively small community can usefully add to the world's
  analysis across a broad array of topics (such as the summed topics
  that bear on "How do we create an existential win?").  But it is
  generally smallish groups (rather than widely dispersed millions of
  people) that can actually bring analysis together; history has often
  involved relatively small intellectual circles that make concerted
  progress; and even if things are already known that bear on how to
  create an existential win, one must probably still combine and
  synthesize that understanding into a smallish set of people that can
  apply the understanding to AI (or what have you).%%</p>

  <p>One feature that is pretty helpful here, is if we somehow maintain a
  single "conversation", rather than a bunch of people separately having
  thoughts and sometimes taking inspiration from one another.  By "a
  conversation", I mean a space where people can e.g. reply to one
  another; rely on shared jargon/shorthand/concepts; build on arguments
  that have been established in common as probably-valid; point out
  apparent errors and then have that pointing-out be actually taken into
  account or else replied-to).</p>
</blockquote>

<li>[claim([6ts])]</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>One feature that really helps things be "a conversation" in this way,
  is if there is a single Schelling set of posts/etc. that people (in
  the relevant community/conversation) are supposed to read, and can be
  assumed to have read.  Less Wrong used to be a such place; right now
  there is no such place; it seems to me highly desirable to form a new
  such place if we can.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>[claim([6tt])]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>We have lately ceased to have a "single conversation" in this way. 
  Good content is still being produced across these communities, but
  there is no single locus of conversation, such that if you're in a
  gathering of e.g. five aspiring rationalists, you can take for granted
  that of course everyone has read posts such-and-such.  There is no one
  place you can post to, where, if enough people upvote your writing,
  people will reliably read and respond (rather than ignore), and where
  others will call them out if they later post reasoning that ignores
  your evidence.  Without such a locus, it is hard for conversation to
  build in the correct way.  (And hard for it to turn into arguments and
  replies, rather than a series of non sequiturs.)</p>
