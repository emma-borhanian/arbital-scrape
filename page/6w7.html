<p>Better in a locally zero-sum way has some direct checks (because the people you're interacting with you have an incentive to see if you're deceiving them about your usefulness), whereas locally positive-sum biases (e.g. "my in group is the best in-group, and is right about everything") should be selected for.</p></p><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/EricBruylant.html">Eric Bruylant</a></p><p><p>I want a clarification on the claim.
