<p>That seems high to me for the first 100 days, since Republicans control both the house and the Senate. However, things could change at the midterm elections in 2018.</p>
<p>Overall I'm going with a 1 in 6 chance during the first term.</p></p><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/EricRogstad.html">Eric Rogstad</a></p><p><p>See also: <a href="http://www.metaculus.com/questions/377/will-donald-trump-be-the-president-of-the-united-states-in-2018/.">http://www.metaculus.com/questions/377/will-donald-trump-be-the-president-of-the-united-states-in-2018/.</a></p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/PatrickLaVictoir.html">Patrick LaVictoire</a></p><p><p>Two ways impeachment could happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump becomes an albatross on the GOP, to the degree that they lose
the House in 2018 despite their geographic advantage (the Democrats
would basically have to win the House popular vote by 6-8 points in
order to get a majority of seats, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-very-early-look-at-the-battle-for-the-house-in-2018/">as per
FiveThirtyEight</a>).
In this case, the Democrat-controlled House would be quite likely to
initiate impeachment proceedings, both because Trump is a worse
President than Pence would be, and because it would put GOP Senators
in a serious bind.</li>
<li>The GOP preemptively impeaches Trump, both to
prevent a bad election cycle for them and because they would prefer
Pence as President.</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren't that unlikely over the next four years, though it won't happen in the first 100 days (barring some bigger bombshell or some real civic virtue from the GOP House leadership).</p></p></div></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/TravisRivera.html">Travis Rivera</a></p><p><p>There have been 3 US presidents where impeachment procedures have taken place against a president.

Otherwise the system doesn't encourage many small updates which at least the GJP suggests is ideal for accuracy in this kind of question.</p></p><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/EricRogstad.html">Eric Rogstad</a></p><p><p>Not currently.</p></p></div></div></section><footer><p class="tagged"><h2>Tagged</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/politics.html">Politics</a></span></p><p class="reverse-related"><h2>Reverse Related</h2><ul class="page-list"><li><a class="page-link" href="../page/politics.html">Politics</a> <q>Tag for political discussion in Arbital Labs</q> - <a class="page-link" href="../page/EricRogstad.html">Eric Rogstad</a></li></ul></p></footer></body></html>
