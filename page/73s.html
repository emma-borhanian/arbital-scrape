Just to get a quick sense of where people are at. And for some claims, it might be really hard to operationalize them. Like this one, "At least 30% more valuable to people sharing models" doesn't make much sense to me.</p></p><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/EricBruylant.html">Eric Bruylant</a></p><p><p>Yep, there's at least high variability. Especially if the things it could be taken to mean are things people generally have similar credence for.</p>
<p>And, <em>nods</em>, this was partly a test of trying to disambiguate a claim, and I found it harder than expected / think I did not do very well. Maybe just words would have been better rather than numbers, and more of them. Or maybe doing a simple version and having other people see where it was ambiguous rather than trying to clarify in a vacuum is easier?</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/AlexeiAndreev.html">Alexei Andreev</a></p><p><p>Yeah, I think <a href="74k.html">More comments and claims should be driven by cruxes.</a>.</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/SatvikBeri.html">Satvik Beri</a></p><p><p>I think a good litmus test is "could two people both strongly agree (or strongly disagree) while actually holding opposing views?" </p>
<p>I also think it makes sense to err on the side of overly unambiguous claims, at least initially: the more restrictive you are, the easier it is to create good discussion norms. </p></p></div></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/AndreaGallagher.html">Andrea Gallagher</a></p><p><p>If claims are primitives, then all the interesting conversations will be at a parent level, which will need to stitch claims together  to make an argument and form a perspective.  I think many of the claims I'm seeing now are not actually primitives, and really need discussion around them to hash out the meaning.  </p>
<p>I would love to see some mechanism to break a claim into both it's definitions of terms and supporting arguments (cruxes, if we want to use that term).</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/TimothyChu.html">Timothy Chu</a></p><p><p>This doesn't seem like a controversial of a claim (be specific and not vague is one of the most timeless heuristics out there), but does seem worth highlighting.</p>
<p>I would like to add that my favorite claim so far  ("Effective Altruism's current message discourages creativity") was not particularly well-specified. ("creativity" and "EA's current message" are not very specific imo).</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/TedSanders.html">Ted Sanders</a></p><p><p>(My first comment on Arbital. Hopefully it contributes.)</p>
<p>As someone who has traded on prediction markets for years, I agree with the sentiment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this claim itself seems really ambiguous. I voted neutral because I'm having a difficult time evaluating what the claim means. I appreciate the attempted clarification of 'at least 30% more valuable to people sharing models', but it leaves me confused. How is value measured? How would I be able to distinguish 20% more valuable from 40% more valuable? And who are these people sharing models? When and where are they doing their sharing?</p>
<p>I think we all agree that language will always have some wiggle room for uncertainty and interpretation. But in this particular case, I have no idea how to distinguish worlds where this statement is true from worlds where this statement is false. That's why I voted neutral.</p>
<p>I wish I could give a more constructive suggestion of how this claim could be reworded. I've spent a few minutes thinking about it but I don't have anything great. If anything, I'd remove the first asterisk.</p></p></div></section><footer><p class="tagged"><h2>Tagged</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/labs_meta.html">Meta (Arbital Labs)</a></span></p><p class="likes"><h2>Likes</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/AndreaGallagher.html">Andrea Gallagher</a>,
