<ul>
<li>$~$\mathbb{P}(yellow\mid banana)$~$ is "the chance that something is yellow, given that we know it is a banana" or equivalently "the chance that a banana is yellow".</li>
<li>$~$\mathbb{P}(banana\mid yellow)$~$ expresses "how much we should think a random object is a banana, after being told that it was yellow" or "the chance that a yellow thing is a banana".</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate a conditional probability $~$\mathbb{P}(X\mid Y)$~$, we consider only the cases where Y is true, and ask about the cases where X is also true.</p>
<p>Suppose a barrel contains 15 round green marbles, 5 round blue marbles, 70 square green marbles, and 10 square blue marbles.  "The probability that a marble is blue, after we've been told that it's round" or "The probability a round marble is blue" is calculated by restricting our attention to only the 20 round marbles, and asking about the 5 marbles that are both blue and round.</p>
<p>Letting $~$\mathbb{P}(blue \wedge round)$~$ denote "the probability a marble is both blue and round":</p>
<p>$~$\mathbb{P}(blue\mid round) := \frac{\mathbb{P}(blue \wedge round)}{\mathbb{P}(round)} = \frac{\text{5% blue and round marbles}}{\text{20% round marbles}} = \frac{5}{20} = 0.25.$~$</p>
<p>In general, $~$\mathbb{P}(X\mid Y) := \frac{\mathbb{P}(X \wedge Y)}{\mathbb{P}(Y)}.$~$]</p>
<p>[summary(Technical):  $~$\mathbb{P}(X\mid Y) := \frac{\mathbb{P}(X \wedge Y)}{\mathbb{P}(Y)}$~$ is the answer to the question, "Assuming $~$Y$~$ to be true, what is the probability of $~$X$~$?" or "Constraining our attention to only possibilities where $~$Y$~$ is true, what is the probability of $~$X \wedge Y$~$ inside those cases?"  (Where $~$X \wedge Y$~$ denotes "X and Y" or "Both X and Y are true".)</p>
<p>Thus, $~$\mathbb P(observation\mid hypothesis)$~$ would denote the <a href="bayesian_likelihood.html">likelihood</a> of seeing some observation, <em>if</em> a hypothesis is true.   $~$\mathbb P(hypothesis\mid observation)$~$ would denote the <a href="bayes_update.html">revised</a> probability we ought to assign to a hypothesis, after learning that the observation was true.]</p>
<p>The conditional probability $~$\mathbb{P}(X\mid Y)$~$ means "The <a href="probability.html">probability</a> of $~$X$~$ given $~$Y$~$."  That is, $~$\mathbb P(left\mid right)$~$ means "The probability that $~$left$~$ is true, assuming that $~$right$~$ is true."</p>
<p>$~$\mathbb P(yellow\mid banana)$~$ is the probability that a banana is yellow - if we know something to be a banana, what is the probability that it is yellow?</p>
<p>$~$\mathbb P(banana\mid yellow)$~$ is the probability that a yellow thing is a banana - if the right side is known to be $~$yellow$~$, then we ask the question on the left, what is the probability that this is a $~$banana$~$?</p>
<h1 id="definition">Definition</h1>
<p>To obtain the probability $~$\mathbb P(left \mid right),$~$ we constrain our attention to only cases where $~$right$~$ is true, and ask about cases within $~$right$~$ where $~$left$~$ is also true.</p>
<p>Let $~$X \wedge Y$~$ denote "$~$X$~$ and $~$Y$~$" or "$~$X$~$ and $~$Y$~$ are both true".  Then:</p>
<p>$$~$\mathbb P(left \mid right) = \dfrac{\mathbb P(left \wedge right)}{\mathbb P(right)}.$~$$</p>
<p>We can see this as a kind of "zooming in" on only the cases where $~$right$~$ is true, and asking, <em>within</em> this universe, for the cases where $~$right$~$ <em>and</em> $~$left$~$ are true.</p>
<h1 id="example1">Example 1</h1>
<p>Suppose you have a bag containing objects that are either red or blue, and either square or round, where the number of each is given by the following table:</p>
<p>$$~$\begin{array}{l\mid r\mid r}
&amp; Red &amp; Blue \\
\hline
Square &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
\hline
Round &amp; 3 &amp; 4
\end{array}$~$$</p>
<p>If you reach in and feel a round object, the conditional probability that it is red is given in by zooming in on only the round objects, and asking about the frequency of objects that are round <em>and</em> red inside this zoomed-in view:</p>
<p>$$~$\mathbb P(red\mid round) = \dfrac{\mathbb P(red \wedge round)}{\mathbb P(round)} = \dfrac{3}{3 + 4} = \dfrac{3}{7}$~$$</p>
<p>If you look at the object nearest the top, and can see that it's blue, but not see the shape, then the conditional probability that it's a square is:</p>
<p>$$~$\mathbb P(square\mid blue) = \dfrac{\mathbb P(square \wedge blue)}{\mathbb P(blue)} = \dfrac{2}{2 + 4} = \dfrac{1}{3}$~$$</p>

<h1 id="example2">Example 2</h1>
<p>Suppose you're Sherlock Holmes investigating a case in which a red hair was left at the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>The Scotland Yard detective says, "Aha!  Then it's Miss Scarlet.  She has red hair, so if she was the murderer she almost certainly would have left a red hair there.  $~$\mathbb P(red hair\mid Scarlet) = 99\%,$~$ let's say, which is a near-certain conviction, so we're done."</p>
<p>"But no," replies Sherlock Holmes.  "You see, but you do not correctly track the meaning of the conditional probabilities, detective.  The knowledge we require for a conviction is not $~$\mathbb P(redhair\mid Scarlet),$~$ the chance that Miss Scarlet would leave a red hair, but rather $~$\mathbb P(Scarlet\mid redhair),$~$ the chance that this red hair was left by Scarlet.  There are other people in this city who have red hair."</p>
<p>"So you're saying…" the detective said slowly, "that $~$\mathbb P(redhair\mid Scarlet)$~$ is actually much lower than $~$1$~$?"</p>
<p>"No, detective.  I am saying that just because $~$\mathbb P(redhair\mid Scarlet)$~$ is high does not imply that $~$\mathbb P(Scarlet\mid redhair)$~$ is high.  It is the latter probability in which we are interested - the degree to which, <em>knowing</em> that a red hair was left at the scene, we <em>infer</em> that Miss Scarlet was the murderer.  This is not the same quantity as the degree to which, <em>assuming</em> Miss Scarlet was the murderer, we would <em>guess</em> that she might leave a red hair."</p>
<p>"But surely," said the detective, "these two probabilities cannot be entirely unrelated?"</p>
<p>"Ah, well, for that, you must read up on <a href="bayes_rule.html">Bayes&#39; rule</a>."</p>
<h1 id="example3">Example 3</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Even if most Dark Wizards are from Slytherin, very few Slytherins are Dark Wizards. There aren't all that many Dark Wizards, so not all Slytherins can be one."</p>
  <p>"So yeh're saying, that most Dark Wizards are Slytherins… but…"</p>
  <p>"But most Slytherins are not Dark Wizards."</p>
