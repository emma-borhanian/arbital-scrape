The notion of "freely reduced" basically tells us that $~$r r^{-1}$~$ is the identity for every letter $~$r \\in X$~$, as is $~$r^{-1} r$~$; this cancellation of inverses is a property we very much want out of a group\.</blockquote>
<p>Are all the words in the free group, or just the freely-reduced words?</p>
<p>If the latter, does saying that the group operation involves free reduction imply that only freely-reduced words will end up in the free group? Because, by default I would assume that "the group has as its element the words over $~$X \cup X^{-1}$~$" means that all the words (including non-freely-reduced ones) are in the free group.</p></main><hr><section class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/PatrickStevens.html">Patrick Stevens</a></p><p><p>You're quite right to flag this up; I was being sloppy.
