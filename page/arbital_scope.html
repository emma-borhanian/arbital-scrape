<h2 id="math">Math</h2>
<p>Currently, Arbital is focusing on becoming the best place online to learn math. This means  that, for all math topics, we're keen to have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="arbital_summaries.html">Summaries</a> - Summaries appear in popovers and are widely seen by readers who want a brief introduction, so improving them or adding them to <a href="needs_summary_meta_tag.html">pages which lack an appropriate one</a> is high-value.</li>
<li><a href="formal_definition_meta_tag.html">Definition pages</a> - Formal definitions of mathematical concepts. These provide foundations for the rest of our content and allow people familiar with the topic to quickly pick up or refresh an idea. Examples: </li>
<li>Explanation pages - Single page explanations of concepts, with different <a href="Arbital_lens.html">lenses</a> for people with different backgrounds. These are best suited to mid-sized concepts, and should aim to teach them intuitively.</li>
<li><a href="how_to_arbital.html">Full guides</a> - Multi-page flexible guides to topics are Arbital's specialty. If you're confident in your ability to explain a complex topic, considering helping to plan and create these (talking to the community on <a href="arbital_slack.html">Slack</a> is usually a good idea, you'll get valuable feedback and assistance on your plans).</li>
<li><a href="external_resources_meta_tag.html">External resources lenses</a> - When users are reading about a topic on Arbital, we'd love to also be able to point them to high-quality external resources where they can learn more, or look at things from another angle. Generally, these links should go in an <em>External resources <a href="Arbital_lens.html">lens</a></em>, connected to an existing main page (don't create a new standalone page just for links to resources, unless there's already a main page with a good summary explanation of the concept -- we want to make sure users who hover over a <a href="arbital_greenlink.html">greenlink</a> to the page will see a good summary).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're familiar with the topics, creating and improving pages which are linked from <a href="guide_meta_tag.html">existing guides</a>, especially [arbital_featured featured] guides, is worth focusing on since more readers will come across them.</p>
<p>[todo: list of possible pages? show/hide?]</p>
<h2 id="otherdomainsofknowledge">Other domains of knowledge</h2>
<p>Pages which are not normally classified as math but which are essentially subtopics of math (like much of theoretical computer science) are welcome. We're [arbital_future looking forward] to expanding into physical science, economics, effective altruism, health, e-sports and many other topics once we're confident we have the features and community to support them, but currently, we don't have domains for them.</p>
<p>Drafts and unlisted pages on other topics may still be created if there's something you're itching to write up, but they won't show up in search for anyone other than you and will be clearly marked as not having been approved. So long as it's not illegal, spam, or in violation of Arbital policy (e.g. <a href="arbital_biographies.html">biography policy</a>) we won't delete it.</p>
<h3 id="mathadjacenttopics">Math-adjacent topics</h3>
<p>Topics which are adjacent to math but not actually math itself such as the history of mathematical ideas, biographies of mathematicians, and applied math in different domains (e.g. economics) are not currently considered part of the math domain. We look forward to expanding into them, but they, like almost all topics, have more potential for controversy than math itself, so we're holding off for now.</p>
<h2 id="blogs">Blogs</h2>
<p>We have <a href="1sp.html">big plans</a> for making Arbital into an awesome blogging platform with smooth interlinking with our network of knowledge, use of requisites for complex topics, and a ready-made audience for high-quality posts. However, currently, we're not well set up for blogging, so unless for some reason you want to use pre-alpha features it's probably best to blog elsewhere for now. </p></main><hr><section class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/EricRogstad.html">Eric Rogstad</a></p><p><blockquote class="comment-context">Currently, Arbital is focusing on becoming the <mark>best place online to learn math</mark>\.

<p>I think this bit is slightly confusing. Is it a new lens per resource?</p>
<p>And what do you mean by standalone resource pages?

<p>I think I'm happy to have TCS concepts on relatively equal footing with other math pages. Are there reasons we shouldn't?</p>

<p>The section sounds slightly too passive to me. What would you think of the following re-write?</p>
<p>External resource lenses - When users are reading about a topic on Arbital, we'd love to also be able to point them to high-quality external resources where they can learn more, or look at things from another angle. Generally, these links should go in an <em>External resources</em> lens, connected to an existing main page. (Don't create a new standalone page just for links to resources, unless there's already a main page with a good summary explanation of the concept -- we want to make sure users who hover over a greenlink to the page will see a good summary.)</p></p></div></section><footer><p class="tagged"><h2>Tagged</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/c_class_meta_tag.html">C-Class</a></span></p><p class="all-creators"><h2>All Creators</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/AlexeiAndreev.html">Alexei Andreev</a>,
