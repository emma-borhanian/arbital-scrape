<p>A <strong>complete lattice</strong> is a <a href="poset.html">poset</a> that is closed under arbitrary <a href="math_join.html">joins and meets</a>. A complete lattice, being closed under arbitrary joins and meets, is closed in particular under binary joins and meets; a complete lattice is thus a specific type of <a href="order_lattice.html">lattice</a>, and hence satisfies <a href="associative_operation.html">associativity</a>, <a href="commutative_operation.html">commutativity</a>, idempotence, and absorption of joins and meets.</p>
<p>Complete lattices can be equivalently formulated as posets which are closed under arbitrary joins; it then follows that complete lattices are closed under arbitrary meets as well.</p>
<p>%%hidden(Proof):
Suppose that $~$P$~$ is a poset which is closed under arbitrary joins. Let $~$A \subseteq P$~$. Let $~$A^L$~$ be the set of lower bounds of $~$A$~$, i.e. the set $~$\{ p \in P \mid \forall a \in A. p \leq a \}$~$. Since $~$P$~$ is closed under joins, we have the existence of $~$\bigvee A^L$~$ in $~$P$~$.  We will now show that $~$\bigvee A^L$~$ is the meet of $~$A$~$.</p>
<p>First, we show that $~$\bigvee A^L$~$ is a lower bound of $~$A$~$. Let $~$a \in A$~$. By the definition of $~$A^L$~$, $~$a$~$ is an upper bound of $~$A^L$~$. Because $~$\bigvee A^L$~$ is less than or equal to any upper bound of $~$A^L$~$, we have $~$\bigvee A^L \leq a$~$. $~$\bigvee A^L$~$ is therefore a lower bound of $~$A$~$.</p>
<p>Now we will show that $~$\bigvee A^L$~$ is greater than or equal to any lower bound of $~$A$~$. Let $~$p \in P$~$ be a lower bound of $~$A$~$. Then $~$p \in A^L$~$.  Because $~$\bigvee A^L$~$ is an upper bound of $~$A^L$~$, we have $~$p \leq \bigvee A^L$~$.

<h1 id="completelatticesarebounded">Complete lattices are bounded</h1>
<p>As a consequence of closure under arbitrary joins, a complete attice $~$L$~$ contains both $~$\bigvee \emptyset$~$ and $~$\bigvee L$~$. The former is the least element of $~$L$~$ satisfying a vacuous set of constraints; every element of $~$L$~$ satisfies a vacuous set of constraints, so this is really the minimum element of $~$L$~$. The latter is an upper bound of all elements of $~$L$~$, and so it is a maximum. A lattice with both minimum and maximum elements is called bounded, and as this discussion has shown, all complete lattices are bounded.</p>
<h1 id="basicexamples">Basic examples</h1>
<h2 id="finitelattices">Finite Lattices</h2>
<p>The collection of all subsets of a finite lattice coincides with its collection of finite subsets. A finite lattice, being a finite poset that is closed under finite joins, is then necessarily closed under arbitrary joins. All finite lattices are therefore complete lattices.</p>
<h2 id="powersets">Powersets</h2>
<p>For any set $~$X$~$, consider the poset $~$\langle \mathcal P(X), \subseteq \rangle$~$ of $~$X$~$'s powerset ordered by inclusion.
This poset is a complete lattice in which for all $~$Y \subset \mathcal P(X)$~$, $~$\bigvee Y = \bigcup Y$~$.</p>
<p>To see that $~$\bigvee Y = \bigcup Y$~$, first note that because union contains all of its constituent sets, for all $~$A \in Y$~$, $~$A \subseteq \bigcup Y$~$. This makes $~$\bigcup Y$~$ an upper bound of $~$Y$~$. Now suppose that $~$B \in \mathcal P(X)$~$ is an upper bound of $~$Y$~$; i.e., for all $~$A \in Y$~$, $~$A \subseteq B$~$. Let $~$x \in \bigcup Y$~$. Then $~$x \in A$~$ for some $~$A \in Y$~$. Since $~$A \subseteq B$~$, $~$x \in B$~$. Hence, $~$\bigcup Y \subseteq B$~$, and so $~$\bigcup Y$~$ is the least upper bound of $~$Y$~$.</p>
<h1 id="theknastertarskifixpointtheorem">The Knaster-Tarski fixpoint theorem</h1>
<p>Suppose that we have a poset $~$X$~$ and a <a href="poset_monotone_function.html">monotone function</a> $~$F : X \to X$~$. An element $~$x \in X$~$ is called $~$F$~$<strong>-consistent</strong> if $~$x \leq F(x)$~$ and is called $~$F$~$<strong>-closed</strong> if $~$F(x) \leq x$~$. A fixpoint of $~$F$~$ is then an element of $~$X$~$ which is both $~$F$~$-consistent and $~$F$~$-closed.</p>
<p>Let $~$A \subseteq X$~$ be the set of all fixpoints of $~$F$~$. We are often interested in the maximum and minimum elements of $~$A$~$, if indeed it has such elements. Most often it is the minimum element of $~$A$~$, denoted $~$\mu F$~$ and called the <strong>least fixpoint</strong> of $~$F$~$, that holds our interest. In the deduction system example from <a href="order_monotone_examples.html">Monotone function: examples</a>, the least fixpoint of the deduction system $~$F$~$ is equal to the set of all judgments which can be proven without assumptions. Knowing $~$\mu F$~$ may be first step toward testing a judgment's membership in $~$\mu F$~$, thus determining whether or not it is provable. In less pedestrian scenarios, we may be interested in the set of all judgments which can be proven without assumption using <em>possibly infinite proof trees</em>; in these cases, it is the <strong>greatest fixpoint</strong> of $~$F$~$, denoted $~$\nu F$~$, that we are interested in.</p>
<p>Now that we've established the notions of the least and greatest fixpoints, let's try an exercise. Namely, I'd like you to think of a lattice $~$L$~$ and a monotone function $~$F : L \to L$~$ such that neither $~$\mu F$~$ nor $~$\nu F$~$ exists.</p>
<p>%%hidden(Show solution):
Let $~$L = \langle \mathbb R, \leq \rangle$~$ and let $~$F$~$ be the identity function $~$F(x) = x$~$. $~$x \leq y \implies F(x) = x \leq y = F(y)$~$, and so $~$F$~$ is monotone. The fixpoints of $~$F$~$ are all elements of $~$\mathbb R$~$. Because $~$\mathbb R$~$ does not have a maximum or minimum element, neither $~$\mu F$~$ nor $~$\nu F$~$ exist.
%%</p>
<p>If that was too easy, here is a harder exercise: think of a complete lattice $~$L$~$ and monotone function $~$F : L \to L$~$ for which neither $~$\mu F$~$ nor $~$\nu F$~$ exist.</p>
<p>%%hidden(Show solution):
There are none. :p
%%</p>
<p>In fact, every monotone function on a complete lattice has both least and greatest fixpoints. This is a consequence of the <strong>Knaster-Tarski fixpoint theorem</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (The Knaster-Tarski fixpoint theorem)</strong>: Let $~$L$~$ be a complete lattice and $~$F : L \to L$~$ a monotone function on $~$L$~$. Then $~$\mu F$~$ exists and is equal to $~$\bigwedge \{x \in L \mid F(x) \leq x\}$~$. Dually, $~$\nu F$~$ exists and is equal to $~$\bigvee \{x \in L \mid x \leq F(x) \}$~$.</p>
<p>%%hidden(Proof):
We know that both $~$\bigwedge \{x \in L \mid F(x) \leq x\}$~$ and $~$\bigvee \{x \in L \mid F(x) \leq x \}$~$ exist due to the closure of complete lattices under meets and joins. We therefore only need to prove that $~$\bigwedge \{x \in L \mid F(x) \leq x\}$~$ is a fixpoint of $~$F$~$ that is less or equal to all other fixpoints of $~$F$~$. The rest follows from duality.</p>
<p>Let $~$U = \{x \in L \mid F(x) \leq x\}$~$ and $~$y = \bigwedge U$~$. We seek to show that $~$F(y) = y$~$. Let $~$V$~$ be the set of fixpoints of $~$F$~$. Clearly, $~$V \subseteq U$~$. Because $~$y \leq u$~$ for all $~$u \in U$~$, $~$y \leq v$~$ for all $~$v \in V$~$. In other words, $~$y$~$ is less than or equal to all fixpoints of $~$F$~$.</p>
<p>For $~$u \in U$~$, $~$y \leq u$~$, and so $~$F(y) \leq F(u) \leq u$~$. Since $~$F(y)$~$ is a lower bound of $~$U$~$, the definition of $~$y$~$ gives $~$F(y) \leq y$~$. Hence, $~$y \in U$~$. Using the monotonicity of $~$F$~$ on the inequality $~$F(y) \leq y$~$ gives $~$F(F(y)) \leq F(y)$~$, and so $~$F(y) \in U$~$. By the definition of $~$y$~$, we then have $~$y \leq F(y)$~$. Since we have established  $~$y \leq F(y)$~$ and $~$F(y) \leq y$~$, we can conclude that $~$F(y) = y$~$.
