<ol>
<li>Who were the most Competent/Agentic folk in history, who had the most Positive Impact, and what were the key variables in allowing them to do so?</li>
<li>What is the role of individuals versus groups versus institutions?</li>
<li>And how do you make long lasting institutions with good epistemic practices?</li>
<li>How big a variable is the social environment you’re in? Even if building institutions is unimportant, is a social environment that strongly supports self-directed work a significant variable?</li>
<li>When do you stop working on skilling-up, and focus on direct work?</li>
<li>What are the novel model-building and strategic heuristics used by the most agentic individuals, and how can one practice them?</li>
<li>Is competence a scalar variable with many different domains of expertise, or is it multivariate with one single domain of expertise (the world)?</li>
</ol>
<p>Brief thoughts on each of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>It seems on a cursory glance, that the most competent people generally have strong technical abilities in their youth, and otherwise have very novel model building heuristics. Trying to replicate a bunch of these might prove useful.</li>
<li>Being able to bring the best people to you and get them to work in coordination to a single goal seems potentially a very significant ability.</li>
<li>Start by learning how to build organisations in general. Look at YC's stuff.</li>
<li>Probably important.</li>
<li>Unknown.</li>
<li>Read books by the top people, and also discuss this with other people trying to work on it too (e.g. CFAR).</li>
<li>I'm currently reading IQ and Human Intelligence (2nd edition) to get a better handle on this.</li>
