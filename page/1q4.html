<p>Can you say more about what you thought was meant?  My reader model doesn't know what interpretation brought you to your guess.</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/SilasBarta.html">Silas Barta</a></p><p><p>I was guessing because it doesn't explicitly say what "meta" would mean here, and based my guess  partly on the expected semantic space covered by  "meta" (roughly, doubling the problem back on itself), and partly on my assumption of the kinds of simple solutions I would expect to be ruled out. My vision of a "simple, meta" solution is thus "brute-force an understanding-free model of a human and take that with you" (which would thus require the model to be"low level" and not find the [non obvious] high level regularities that can't be brute forced). </p>
<p>Hope that clarified how I came up with that, but in any case, an explicit definition would help, as would a prequisite on "meta solutions".</p></p></div></section><footer></footer></body></html>
