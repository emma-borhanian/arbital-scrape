These terms grew organically over the history of modern mathematics, so the overall list of names is a bit arbitrary (and in a few cases, some authors will use slightly different assumptions about certain terms, such as whether a semiring needs to have identity elements). This list is intended to clarify the situation to someone who has some familiarity with what an algebraic structure is, but not a lot of experience with using these specific terms.</p>
<pre>%%comment:Tree is the wrong word; this should be more of an algebraic structure collection of disjoint directed acyclic graphs? But this is what other pages seem to have chosen to link to, so here we are!%%</pre>
<h1 id="onesetonebinaryoperation">One set, one binary operation</h1>
<ul>
<li>[Groupoid], sometimes known as a magma. This is the freebie. Have a set and a binary operation? That's a groupoid.<ul>
<li>A [-semigroup] is a groupoid where <em>the operation is <a href="associative_operation.html">associative</a></em>.<ul>
<li>A <a href="algebraic_monoid.html">Monoid</a> is a semigroup where <em>the operation has an <a href="identity_element.html">Identity element</a></em>.<ul>
<li>A <a href="group_mathematics.html">Group</a> is a monoid where <em>every element has an [-inverse_element] under the binary operation</em>.<ul>
<li>An <a href="abelian_group.html">Abelian group</a> is a group where <em>the binary operation is <a href="commutative_operation.html">commutative</a></em>.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>A [-semilattice] is a semigroup where <em>the operation is [Idempotent_operation idempotent] and commutative</em>.</li></ul></li>
<li>A [-quasigroup] is a groupoid where <em>every element has a [quotient_algebra left and right quotient] under the binary operation</em> (sometimes called the [Latin_square_property]).<ul>
<li>A [Algebraic_loop loop] is a quasigroup <em>with identity</em>.</li>
<li>A <strong>group</strong>, as defined above, can also be defined as a (non-empty) quasigroup where <em>the operation is associative</em> ([ quotients and associativity give a two-sided identity and two-sided inverses], provided there's at least one element to be that identity).</li></ul></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="onesettwobinaryoperations">One set, two binary operations</h1>
<p>For the below, we'll use $~$*$~$ and $~$\circ$~$ to denote the two binary operations in question. It might help to think of $~$*$~$ as "like addition" and $~$\circ$~$ as "like multiplication", but be careful&mdash;in most of these structures, properties of addition and multiplication like commutativity won't be assumed!</p>
<ul>
<li>[Ringoid] assumes only that $~$\circ$~$ distributes over $~$*$~$&mdash;in other words, $~$a \circ (b * c) = (a \circ b) * (a \circ c)$~$ and $~$(a * b) \circ c = (a \circ c) * (b \circ c)$~$.<ul>
<li>A [-semiring] is a ringoid where <em>both $~$*$~$ and $~$\circ$~$ define semigroups</em>.<ul>
<li>An [-additive_semiring] is a semiring where $~$*$~$ <em>is commutative</em>.<ul>
<li>A [-rig] is an additive semiring where $~$*$~$ <em>has an identity element</em>. (It's almost a ring! It's just missing <b>n</b>egatives.)<ul>
<li>A <a href="algebraic_ring.html">Ring</a> is a rig where <em>every element has an inverse element under</em> $~$*$~$. (Some authors also require $~$\circ$~$ to have an identity to call the structure a ring.)<ul>
<li>A <strong>ring with unity</strong> is a ring where $~$\circ$~$ <em>has an identity</em>. (Some authors just use the word "ring" for this; others use variations like "unit ring".)<ul>
<li>A [-division_ring] is a ring with unity where <em>every element (except for the identity of $~$*$~$) has an inverse element under</em> $~$\circ$~$.<ul>
<li>A <a href="algebraic_field.html">field</a> is a division ring where $~$\circ$~$ <em>is commutative</em>.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>A <a href="order_lattice.html">lattice</a> is a ringoid where <em>both $~$*$~$ and $~$\circ$~$ define semilattices, and satisfy the absorption laws ($~$a \circ (a * b) = a * (a \circ b) = a$~$)</em>. (While we'll continue to use $~$*$~$ and $~$\circ$~$ here, the two operations of a lattice are almost always denoted with [3rc $~$\wedge$~$ and $~$\vee$~$].)<ul>
<li>A [-bounded_lattice] is a lattice where <em>both operations have identities</em>.</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Tables! Specifically, a table of the structures going down and the properties they require going across would be a much clearer way to summarize this information. I tried HTML tables and preformatted-text ASCII tables here but couldn't get either to work.</li>
<li>Some indication of what collection of properties imply other properties, or what collection of properties don't get their own name because they're logically impossible.</li>
<li>A way to toggle between different naming conventions, as described in the text when different authors assume different axioms with the same word.</li>
<li>Visual highlighting for the most important members of the tree—if you're just starting out in abstract algebra, knowing what a field is is much more important than knowing what a rig is.</li>
