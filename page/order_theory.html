<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Order pervades mathematics and the sciences. Often, a reader's intuitive notion of order is all that is necessary for understanding a particular invocation of the notion of order. However, a deeper examination of order reveals a rich taxonomy over the types of orderings that can arise and leads to powerful theorems with applications in mathematics, computer science, the natural sciences, and the social sciences.</p>
<p>The following are examples of orders that one might encounter in life:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a work place, employees may have a <em>rank</em> that determines which other employees they have authority over. IT workers report to the IT manager, marketers report to the marketing manager, managers report to the CEO, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>In a grocery store, someone planning to buy corn flake cereal may consider the ordering on the <em>prices</em> of various brands of shredded wheat to decide which to purchase.</p></li>
<li><p>At lunchtime, someone with a craving for burritos may order the nearby burrito restaurants by their <em>distance</em> from her workplace. She may also order these burrito joints by <em>quality</em>, and consider both orderings in her decision.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we've seen some concrete examples of order, we can begin working toward a rigorous mathematical definition. In each of the above examples, we have some <em>underlying set</em> of objects that we are comparing: employees, corn flake brands, and burrito restaurants, respectively. We also have an <em>ordering</em>, which is a <a href="relation_mathematics.html">binary relation</a> determining whether or not one object is "less than" another. This suggests that order esentially a pair of a set and some binary relation defined on it. Is this all we need to capture the notion of order?</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of binary relations which may or may not be orderings. Do they agree with your intuitive notion of ordering?</p>
<ul>
<li>1.) The relation which includes all pairs of people $~$(a,b)$~$ such that $~$a$~$ and $~$b$~$ are friends.</li>
<li>2.) The relation of pairs of people $~$(a,b)$~$ such that $~$a$~$ is a genetic descendant of $~$b$~$.</li>
<li>3.) The relation on days of the week which contains the exactly pairs $~$(a,b)$~$ such that a directly precedes b: $~$\{ (Monday, Tuesday), (Tuesday, Wednesday), … \}$~$</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out that only item 2 agrees with the mathematical definition of ordering. Intuitively, item 1 is not an ordering because of its symmetry: a friendship between two people does not distinguish one friend as being "less than" the other (not a healthy friendship, at least). Friendship is actually an instance of another important class of binary relations called the [equivalence_relation_mathematics equivalence relations]. Item 3 is not an ordering because it lacks transitivity: Monday directly precedes Tuesday and Tuesday directly precedes Wednesday, but Monday does not directly precede Wednesday.</p>
<h1 id="posets">Posets</h1>
<p>We're now ready to provide a formal, mathematical definition, for a class of objects called <em>posets</em> (a contraction of partially ordered set), which captures the idea of ordering.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p><strong>Definition: Poset</strong></p>
<p>A <em>poset</em> is a pair $~$\langle P, \leq \rangle$~$ of a set $~$P$~$ and a binary relation $~$\leq$~$ on $~$P$~$ such that for all $~$p,q,r \in P$~$, the following properties are satisfied: </p>
<ul>
<li>Reflexivity: $~$p \leq p$~$</li>
<li>Transitivity: $~$p \leq q$~$ and  $~$q \leq r$~$ implies $~$p \leq r$~$</li>
<li>Anti-Symmetry: $~$p \leq q$~$ and $~$q \leq p$~$ implies $~$p = q$~$</li>
</ul>
<p>$~$P$~$ is referred to as the poset's <em>underlying set</em> and $~$\leq$~$
 is referred to as its <em>order relation</em>.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The above definition may strike some readers as more general than expected. Indeed, in both mathematics and conversational English, when someone states that a set of objects is ordered, they often mean that it is totally ordered. A total order is a poset for which any two elements of $~$a$~$ and $~$b$~$ of the underlying set are <em>comparable</em>; that is, $~$a \leq b$~$ or $~$b \leq a$~$. But our definition of a poset allows the possibility that two elements are <em>incomparable</em>. Recall our example of employees in a work place. In our <em>reports-to</em> relation, both an IT manager and a marketing manager report to the CEO; however, it would not make sense for an IT manager to report to a marketing manager or vice versa. The marketing and IT managers are thus incomparable. We write $~$a \parallel b$~$ to state that two poset elements $~$a$~$ and $~$b$~$ are incomparable.</p>
<p>Another important distinction must be made. Partial orders as we have described them are not <em>strict</em> orders. From any poset $~$\langle P, \leq \rangle$~$, we can derive an strict order relation $~$&lt;$~$, which includes exactly those pairs of $~$\leq$~$ relating two elements of $~$P$~$ that are distinct. It should be noted that, while strict orders are transitive and vacuously anti-symmetric, they are <em>not</em> partial orders because they are not reflexive. In everyday situations, strict orders seem to be more useful, but in mathematics non-strict orderings are of more use, and so non-strictness is built into the definition of poset.</p></main><hr><section class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/AlexeiAndreev.html">Alexei Andreev</a></p><p><p><a href="KevinClancy.html">Kevin Clancy</a>, did you intend to make this a blog page (owned by you) as opposed to a wiki page (owned by community)?</p>
