The second requirement asserts that a metric must be commutative; informally the distance from $~$a$~$ to $~$b$~$ must be the same as the distance from $~$b$~$ to $~$a$~$\. Finally, the third requirement is known as the triangle inequality and asserts that the distance from $~$a$~$ to $~$c$~$ is at most as large as the sum of the distances from $~$a$~$ to $~$b$~$ and from $~$b$~$ to $~$c$~$\. It is named as such because in Euclidean space, the points $~$a$~$, $~$b$~$, and $~$c$~$ form a triangle, and the inequality requires that the length of one side of the triangle is not longer than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides; violating this would mean that the shortest path between two points is no longer the straight line between them\.</blockquote>
<p>This is a clear explanation, but I think some formatting changes could enable readers to grok it even more quickly.</p>
<p>Suppose a reader understands two of the three requirements and just needs an explanation of the third. It would be cool if they could find the sentences they're looking for w/o having to scan a whole paragraph looking for the words, "first", "second", or "third".</p>
<p>I think we can achieve this by A) moving each explanation right under the equation / inequality it's talking about, or B) putting the three explanations in a second numbered list, or C) leaving the three explanations in a paragraph, but use the numerals 1, 2, and 3 within the paragraph. Might require some experimentation to see what looks best.</p></main><hr><section class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/BryceWoodworth.html">Bryce Woodworth</a></p><p><p>Thanks for the feedback! I'd prefer to have the explanations underneath the requirement they refer to, but I haven't been able to get the spacing to look good. I added numbers into the paragraph to make it visually easy to find where each requirement is discussed. If I get the spacing to work well, I'll switch to that.</p></p></div></section><footer></footer></body></html>
