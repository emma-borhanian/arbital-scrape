They say some equivalent of, "There's no universal good strategy:  For every universe where an action causes you to gain \$5, there's a different universe where that same action causes you to lose \$5.  You can't get a <em>free lunch</em> across every universe; if you gain \$5 in one possible world you must lose \$5 in another possible world."</p>
<p>To this the realistic reply is very often, "Okay, that's true across maximum-entropy universes in general.  But the real world is an extremely special case.  We happen to live in a low-entropy universe, where things are far more ordered and predictable than in a universe where all the atoms have been placed at random; and the world where we gain \$5 is far more probable than the world where we lose \$5."</p>

In practice, biology is happy to select proteins that reliably fold up a particular way even if they don't reach the exact theoretical minimum.  "NP-hard" problems in real life with nonrandom data often have regularities that make them much more easily solvable than the worst-case problems; or they have pretty good approximate solutions.]</p>
<p>There's a wide variety of "No Free Lunch" theorems proving that, in general, some problem is unsolvable.  Very often, these theorems are not relevant because the real universe is a special case.</p>
<p>In a very general and metaphorical sense, most of these theorems say some equivalent of, "There's no universal good strategy:  For every universe where an action causes you to gain \$5, there's a different universe where that same action causes you to lose \$5.  You can't get a <em>free lunch</em> across every universe; if you gain \$5 in one universe you must lose \$5 in another universe."  To which the reply is very often, "Sure, that's true across maximum-entropy universes in general, but we happen to live in a low-entropy universe where things are far more ordered and predictable than in a universe where all the atoms have been placed at random."</p>
<p>Similarly:  In theory, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding">protein folding problem</a> (predicting the lowest-energy configuration for a string of amino acids) is NP-hard (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1372">sorta</a>).  But since quantum mechanics is not known to solve NP-hard problems, this just means that in the real world, some proteins fold up in a way that doesn't reach the ideal lowest energy.  Biology is happy with just picking out proteins that reliably fold up a particular way.  "NP-hard" problems in real life with nonrandom data often have regularities that make them much more easily solvable than the worst cases; or they have pretty good approximate solutions; or we can work with just the solvable cases.</p>
<p>A related but distinct idea:  It's impossible to prove in general whether a Turing machine halts, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem">has any other nontrivial property</a> since it might be conditioned on a subprocess halting.  But that often doesn't stop us from picking particular machines that do halt, or limiting our consideration to computations that run in less than a quadrillion timesteps, etcetera.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean <em>all</em> No-Free-Lunch theorems are irrelevant in the real-universe special case.  E.g., the Second Law of Thermodynamics can also be seen as a No-Free-Lunch theorem, and does actually prohibit perpetual motion in our own real universe (on the standard model of physics).</p>
<p>It should finally be observed that human intelligence does work in the real world, meaning that there's no No-Free-Lunch theorem which prohibits an intelligence from working at least that well.  Any claim that a No-Free-Lunch theorem prohibits machine intelligence in general, must definitely <a href="prove_too_much.html">Prove Too Much</a>, because the same reasoning could be applied to a human brain considered as a physical system.</p></main><hr><section class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/AlexeiAndreev.html">Alexei Andreev</a></p><p><blockquote class="comment-context">Similarly:  In theory, the protein folding problem \(predicting the lowest\-energy configuration for a string of amino acids\) is NP\-hard \(sorta\)\.

<p>This is interesting! Is there a name for this concept / area of thought?</p></p></div></section><footer><p class="likes"><h2>Likes</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/AlexeiAndreev.html">Alexei Andreev</a>,
