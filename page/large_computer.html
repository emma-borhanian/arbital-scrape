<p>An unphysically large finite computer is one that's vastly larger than anything that could possibly fit into our universe, if the <em>character</em> of physical law is anything remotely like it seems to be.</p>
<p>We might be able to get a googol ($~$10^{100}$~$) computations out of this universe by being clever, but to get $~$10^{10^{100}}$~$ computations would require outrunning proton decay and the second law of thermodynamics, and $~$9 \uparrow\uparrow 4$~$ operations ($~$9^{9^{9^9}}$~$) would require amounts of computing substrate in contiguous internal communication that wouldn't fit inside a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_volume">Hubble Volume</a>.  Even tricks that permit the creation of new universes and encoding computations into them probably wouldn't allow a single computation of size $~$9 \uparrow\uparrow 4$~$ to return an answer, if the character of physical law is anything like what it appears to be.</p>
<p>Thus, in a practical sense, computations that would require sufficiently large finite amounts of computation are pragmatically equivalent to computations that require <a href="hypercomputer.html">hypercomputers</a>, and serve a similar purpose in unbounded analysis - they let us talk about interesting things and crisply encode relations that might take a lot of unnecessary overhead to describe using <em>small</em> finite computers.  Nonetheless, since there are some mathematical pitfalls of considering infinite cases, reducing a problem to one guaranteed to only require a vast finite computer can sometimes be an improvement or yield new insights - especially when dealing with interesting recursions.</p>
