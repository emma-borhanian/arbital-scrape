If you end up coming on time, then you get no social penalty for being not on-time (blue line at t="on time"), but you get a social penalty for being off your stated mark (red U at t="on time"). If you show up 10 minutes late, as you said you would, you get some social penalty for being late (blue line at t="10 mins late"), but a <em>small amount</em> of social penalty from red U (at t="10 mins late") because you actually showed up when you said you would (i.e. 10 minutes later). The reason it's <em>small amount</em> and not zero is because you are still 10 minutes late from the original time. If you said you would be 9 minutes later, then U would be closer to x-axis; at 5 minutes, it would be presumably half as high from the x-axis; and if you said you were running on-time and showed up on-time, then it would be tangent to x-axis (and t="on time" and t="reported ETA" would be the same).</p>
<p>One thing that's a bit misleading is that earlier in the post Paul says: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My total delay is the sum of two terms:<br />
  <strong>Error</strong>: How badly I messed up my departure time. If this term is large then it signals incompetence and disrespect.<br />
  <strong>Noise</strong>: How unlucky I got with respect to traffic (and other random factors). This doesn’t really signal much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Error is the blue line. Noise is the red U, but he still counts that as social penalty. I guess it just doesn't factor into "signaling", meaning the other person might still be somewhat upset, but they won't take delay from noise as evidence about you.</p></main><hr><footer></footer></body></html>
