<p>Given the generality of computers, you might be tempted to say everything, but it turns out that this is not the case.</p>
<p>To begin tackling this problem, we need a formal notion of what it means to compute something. We are going to focus on computing <strong>natural functions</strong>; that is, <a href="function.html">functions</a> which transform <a href="natural_number.html">natural numbers</a> to natural numbers.</p>
<p>As natural numbers can be used to encode pretty much anything, this class of computations is far wider than one might initially think. For example, we can [-encode] finite sequences of arbitrary length of natural numbers in a single natural number, and we can encode words in sequences of numbers.</p>
<p>We are going to say that a computer program computes a certain natural function if on input $~$n$~$ it returns the result of applying such function to $~$n$~$, for every natural $~$n$~$. We note that programs do not have to halt on inputs; they may just run forever. In that case, we will say that the program is computing a partial function, which is not defined on some inputs.</p>
<p>%%%knows-requisite(<a href="uncountable.html">Uncountability</a>):
Now, the first thing to notice is that the set of possible functions from $~$\mathbb{N}$~$ to $~$\mathbb{N}$~$ is not [-enumerable], while the set of possible programs, which are finite sequences of a finite quantity of symbols, is enumerable. Thus, there cannot be a one-to-one correspondence between functions and programs; there must necessarily exist a function which is not computed by any program.</p>
<p>So computers cannot compute everything!

<h2 id="thediagonalfunction">The diagonal function</h2>
<p>We are going to construct a concrete example of a function which is not computable.</p>
<p>Imagine an infinite list of every possible Python program, associated with the infinite outputs each would produce if we feed it the sequence of natural numbers $~$1,2,3,…$~$.</p>
<p>Thus, we may end up with a table such as this:</p>
<p>program #1: 0-&gt;1, 1-&gt;X, 2-&gt;3,…</p>
<p>program #2:</p>
<p>etc…</p>
<p>Where an X means that the program does not halt on that input or does not return an output, and thus the function it represents is not defined there.</p>
<p>Now, we are going to construct an explicit function which is not computable using this table.</p>
<p>Let $~$DIAG$~$ be such that:
$$~$
DIAG(n) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    1\ if\ M_n(n) = 0\\
    0\ if\ M_n(n)\mbox{ is undefined or defined and greater than 0}
  \end{array}
\right.
$~$$</p>
<p>The notation $~$M_n$~$ means <em>"the $~$n$~$th program in our enumeration of programs"</em>. 
Let's see what we have done there. We are looking at the $~$n$~$th entry of every program and saying that this function on input $~$n$~$ outputs something different that the $~$n$~$th program. This technique is called [-diagonalization], and it is ubiquitous in computability and logic.</p>
<p>The function $~$DIAG$~$, known as the [-diagonal_function], is guaranteed to disagree with every program on at least one input. Thus, there cannot be a program which computes $~$DIAG$~$!</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="thehaltingfunction">The halting function</h2>
<p>The reader may at this point be however not satisfied with such an unnatural example of an uncomputable function. After all, who is going to want to compute such a weird thing? Do not dismay, for there is a much better example: the halting function.</p>
<p>Let $~$HALT$~$ be defined as:
$$~$
HALT(n,x) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    1\ if\ M_n(x)\mbox{ halts}\\
    0\ if\ M_n(x)\mbox{ does not halt }
  \end{array}
\right.
$~$$</p>
<p>That is, the function $~$HALT$~$ decides whether a given program is going to halt on a particular input. Now that is interesting.</p>
<p>To cite one imaginative use of the halting function, one could for example code a program which on any input simply ignores the input and starts looking for a counterexample of the Collatz conjecture, halting <a href="iff.html">Iff</a> it finds one. Then we could use the halting function to see whether the conjecture is true or false.</p>
<p>Sadly, $~$HALT$~$ is not computable. We are going to give two proofs of this fact, one by <strong>reduction</strong> to the diagonal function and other by <strong>diagonalization</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="proofbyreduction">Proof by reduction</h3>
<p>Proofs by <strong>reduction</strong> are quite common in computability. We start by supposing that the function we are dealing with, in this case $~$HALT$~$, is computable, and then we proceed to use this assumption to show that if that was the case we could compute another function we know is uncomputable.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a program, which we are going to represent by $~$HALT$~$, which computes the halting function.</p>
<p>Then we could write a program such as this one:</p>
<pre><code>DIAGONAL(n):
    if HALT(n,n):
        return 1 if M_n==0 else return 0
else return 0
</code></pre>
<p>Which computes the diagonal function. As we know such a program cannot possibly exist, we conclude by <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> that $~$HALT$~$ is not computable.</p>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>
<p>Prove that $~$HALT$~$ is reducible to $~$DIAGONAL$~$; ie, that if $~$DIAGONAL$~$ was computable we could compute $~$HALT$~$.</p>
<p>%%hidden(Show solution):
Suppose we want to know whether the program $~$PROG$~$ halts on input $~$n$~$. Then we first code the auxiliary program:</p>
<pre><code>AUX(x): 
    PROG(n)
    return 0
</code></pre>
<p>That is, $~$AUX$~$ is the program which on any input first runs $~$PROG$~$ on input $~$n$~$ and then outputs $~$0$~$ if $~$PROG$~$ ever halts.</p>
<p>Then $~$DIAG(\ulcorner AUX\urcorner)==1$~$ iff $~$PROG$~$ halts on input $~$n$~$.
%%</p>
<h3 id="proofbydiagonalization">Proof by diagonalization</h3>
<p>Another nifty proof of uncomputability comes from diagonalization.</p>
<p>As before, let's suppose $~$HALT$~$ is computable. Then we could write a program such as this one:</p>
<pre><code>prog(n):
    if HALT(n,n)==1: 
       loop forever
    else return 0
</code></pre>
<p>The program halts on input $~$n$~$ iff $~$M_n$~$ does not halt on input $~$n$~$.</p>
<p>Now, let $~$\ulcorner prog\urcorner$~$ represent the number in the list of the program which occupies the $~$prog$~$ program. Here comes the question: does $~$prog$~$ halt when its input is $~$\ulcorner prog \urcorner$~$?</p>
<p>Supposing either yes or no leads to a contradiction, so we conclude that such a program cannot possibly exist, and it follows from the contradiction that $~$HALT$~$ is not computable.</p>
<hr />
<p>So now you are ready to start your journey through the realm of computability!</p>
<p>Suggested next steps include examining other uncomputable functions such as the [ busy beaver sequence], or proceeding to [ complexity theory].</p></main><hr><section class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/AlexeiAndreev.html">Alexei Andreev</a></p><p><blockquote class="comment-context">
