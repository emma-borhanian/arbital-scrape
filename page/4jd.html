<p>I might try to introduce these terms one at a time, and a bit more slowly -- the paragraph up to this point reads like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_English">Simple English</a> (good!), and then in the last two sentences I've got two terms thrown at me.</p>
<p>I think if a reader doesn't yet know what an isomorphism is, it would be helpful to spend more time building the intuition that there's something the same about both boxes, maybe like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If there aren't any left over, then you know there were the same number of items in each box. So to Count von Count, who only cares about counting things, the two boxes are basically equivalent, and might as well be the same box. Whenever two objects are the <em>same</em> from a certain perspective, we say that they are <em>isomorphic</em>.</p>
  <p>In this example, the way in which the boxes were the same is that you could pair up each item in one box with an item in the other (which you wouldn't have been able to do if the boxes had different numbers of elements). Whenever you can match each item in one set with exactly one item in another set, we say that the sets are [-bijective] and the way you paired them is a [-bijection]. %%note: Note that two sets have to have the same number of elements to be bijective, but that's not enough &mdash; you also need some way to say which item in one should be paired with which item in the other. In the case above, we paired the items up using the order in which they were removed from their boxes.%% A bijection is a kind of isomorphism.</p>
