Todd Rose Â© 2016%%  The goal was to update the average pilot size, which was used to design and build cockpits and hadn't been remeasured since 1926.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7mPe4CC.gif" width="300"></p>
<p>However, when Lieutenant Gilbert S. Daniels compared the new average with the individual pilot records, he discovered something startling: not a <em>single one</em> of the four-thousand-plus pilots was within 15% of the average on the ten most relevant dimensions (things like height and chest circumference).  In fact, for any given <em>three</em> dimensions, fewer than 4% of the pilots would qualify as average.  There simply was no such thing as an "average" pilot, and therefore cockpits designed for the average fit nobody.  </p>
<p>Daniels' discovery led to the creation of adjustable seats and straps like those we find in cars and helmets today, along with a corresponding increase in pilot comfort and performance.  It's a useful shorthand for the idea that "one size fits all" strategies are rarely as effective as flexible or modular strategies.</p></main><hr><footer><p class="likes"><h2>Likes</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/MalcolmMcCrimmon.html">Malcolm McCrimmon</a></span></p></footer></body></html>
