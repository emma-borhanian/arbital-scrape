<h2 id="gemlabsoverview">GeM Labs Overview</h2>
<h3 id="prioritisingkeyissues">Prioritising key issues</h3>
<p>Global coordination has never been more crucial, yet it seems out of reach. Mass unemployment, migration, existential risks, failing governance – we are facing difficult times and daunting challenges. We, therefore, need to explore innovative ways of building up global cooperation and filter out the most promising ones to work on.</p>
<h3 id="openinnovationandexpertise">Open innovation and expertise</h3>
<p>Currently, experts and their insights are often pitched to a public whom the internet has empowered to voice strong opinions, underrating extensive experience and research. However, if we want to continue to live in a thriving society, we need to count on the acquired expertise and evidence of many small groups from different sectors. Yet, we are lacking the proper pipelines for these groups to collectively build up policies from scratch, as well as to translate their expertise for the laymen. Such efforts have to become standard practice. With your help, GeM Labs can become this pipeline, fostering collaboration among the private sector, academia, non-profits and policy makers to demonstrate the value of expert driven collaboration and set new standards in open innovation.</p>
<h2 id="keystosuccess">Keys to success</h2>
<p>GeM Labs is characterised by a unique and solution driven framework of principles to achieve its vision. Our Charter, laid down following key principles of effective altruism and elaborated with international experts, outlines how we will drive the platform’s focus to solve problems</p>
<p>To further drive success, we are actively seeking out unconditional financial support, as well as partnerships to increase network effects, visibility and spread crucial information across all possible channels.</p>
<h3 id="attainingsolutions">Attaining solutions</h3>
<p>Every six months, we will treat a different, burning issue of global and future importance. Among the current potential topics are geoengineering, migration and the development of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The minimum outcome is the publication of our aggregated knowledge as a white paper detailing conclusions and concrete next steps to drive action.</p>
<p>Each cycle will consist of three different activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public events will start the debate and gather views of our members. They are the key landmarks to promote
the values and outcomes of the platform in order to inform public discourse and influence political agenda
setting.</li>
<li>In-person working groups will aggregate our members’ knowledge in collaboration with our support team to
develop the outcomes. </li>
<li>All content will be digitised to enable experts to contribute selectively from anywhere at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dissemination of the bundled wisdom and our proposed solutions will be achieved through traditional, digital and social media, international organisations, other think tanks and direct correspondence with leading decision makers.</p></main><hr><footer><p class="all-creators"><h2>All Creators</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/GenevaMacroLabs.html">Geneva Macro Labs</a>,
