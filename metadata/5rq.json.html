  text: 'Is there no standard perspective that says:\n\nVery few elections are decided by a single vote, but those that do are sufficiently important that it&#39;s worth voting (especially in close areas)? Naive expected value calculation, which sometimes comes out positive without any need for serious decision-theoretic analysis (because from your perspective, your chance of being the deciding vote is proportional to the size of the system you&#39;re potentially moving)?\n\nIf you&#39;re only talking about the case where an election has a clear winner in advance and your vote is, based on your knowledge of the system, extraordinarily unlikely to tip the balance (by enough to outweigh the size of the effect compared to you, which the current example definitely does not do), then I could see discarding that, but it should be addressed or a situation set up to remove it.',
