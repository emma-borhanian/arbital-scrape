  text: '[summary: An irreducible element of a [3gq ring] is one which cannot be written as a nontrivial product of two other elements of the ring.]\n\n[summary(Technical): Let $(R, +, \\times)$ be a [3gq ring] which is an [5md integral domain]. We say $x \\in R$ is *irreducible* if, whenever we write $r = a \\times b$, it is the case that (at least) one of $a$ or $b$ is a [5mg unit] (that is, has a multiplicative inverse).]\n\n[3gq Ring theory] can be viewed as the art of taking the integers [48l $\\mathbb{Z}$] and extracting or identifying its essential properties, seeing where they lead.\nIn that light, we might ask what the abstracted notion of &quot;[4mf prime]&quot; should be.\nConfusingly, we call this property *irreducibility* rather than &quot;primality&quot;; &quot;[5m2 prime]&quot; in ring theory corresponds to something closely related but not the same.\n\nIn a ring $R$ which is an [-5md], we say that an element $x \\in R$ is *irreducible* if, whenever we write $r = a \\times b$, it is the case that (at least) one of $a$ or $b$ is a [5mg unit] (that is, has a multiplicative inverse).\n\n# Why do we require $R$ to be an integral domain?\n[todo: this]\n\n# Examples\n[todo: lots]\n\n# Relationship with primality in the ring-theoretic sense\n\nIt is always the case that [5m2 primes] are irreducible in any integral domain.\n%%hidden(Show proof):\nIf $p$ is prime, then $p \\mid ab$ implies $p \\mid a$ or $p \\mid b$ by definition.\nWe wish to show that if $p=ab$ then one of $a$ or $b$ is invertible.\n\nSuppose $p = ab$.\nThen in particular $p \\mid ab$ so $p \\mid a$ or $p \\mid b$.\nAssume without loss of generality that $p \\mid a$; so there is some $c$ such that $a = cp$.\n\nTherefore $p = ab = cpb$; we are working in a commutative ring, so $p(1-bc) = 0$.\nSince the ring is an integral domain and $p$ is prime (so is nonzero), we must have $1-bc = 0$ and hence $bc = 1$.\nThat is, $b$ is invertible.\n%%\n\nHowever, the converse does not hold (though it may in certain rings).\n\n- In $\\mathbb{Z}$, it is a fact that irreducibles are prime. Indeed, it is a consequence of [5mp BÃ©zout&#39;s theorem] that if $p$ is &quot;prime&quot; in the usual $\\mathbb{Z}$-sense (that is, irreducible in the rings sense) %%note:I&#39;m sorry about the notation. It&#39;s just what we&#39;re stuck with. It is very confusing.%%, then $p$ is &quot;prime&quot; in the rings sense. ([5mh Proof.])\n- In the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-3}]$ of [4zw complex numbers] of the form $a+b \\sqrt{-3}$ where $a, b$ are integers, the number $2$ is irreducible but we may express $4 = 2 \\times 2 = (1+\\sqrt{-3})(1-\\sqrt{-3})$. That is, we have $2 \\mid (1+\\sqrt{-3})(1-\\sqrt{-3})$ but $2$ doesn&#39;t divide either of those factors. Hence $2$ is not prime.\n\n%%hidden(Proof that $2$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-3}]):\nA slick way to do this goes via the [norm_complex_number norm] $N(2)$ of the complex number $2$; namely $4$.\n\nIf $2 = ab$ then $N(2) = N(a)N(b)$ because [norm_of_complex_number_is_multiplicative the norm is a multiplicative function], and so $N(a) N(b) = 4$.\nBut $N(x + y \\sqrt{-3}) = x^2 + 3 y^2$ is an integer for any element of the ring, and so we have just two distinct options: $N(a) = 1, N(b) = 4$ or $N(a) = 2 = N(b)$.\n(The other cases follow by interchanging $a$ and $b$.)\n\nThe first case: $N(x+y \\sqrt{3}) = 1$ is only possible if $x= \\pm 1, y = \\pm 0$.\nHence the first case arises only from $a=\\pm1, b=\\pm2$; this has not led to any new factorisation of $2$.\n\nThe second case: $N(x+y \\sqrt{3}) = 2$ is never possible at all, since if $y \\not = 0$ then the norm is too big, while if $y = 0$ then we are reduced to finding $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $x^2 = 2$.\n\nHence if we write $2$ as a product, then one of the factors must be invertible (indeed, must be $\\pm 1$).\n%%\n\nIn fact, in a [-principal_ideal_domain], &quot;prime&quot; and &quot;irreducible&quot; are equivalent. ([5mf Proof.])\n\n# Relationship with unique factorisation domains\n\nIt is a fact that an integral domain $R$ is a [unique_factorisation_domain UFD] if and only if it has &quot;all irreducibles are [5m2 prime] (in the sense of ring theory)&quot; and &quot;every $r \\in R$ may be written as a product of irreducibles&quot;. ([alternative_condition_for_ufd Proof.])\nThis is a slightly easier condition to check than our original definition of a UFD, which instead of &quot;all irreducibles are prime&quot; had &quot;products are unique up to reordering and multiplying by invertible elements&quot;.\n\nTherefore the relationship between irreducibles and primes is at the heart of the nature of a unique factorisation domain.\nSince $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD, in some sense the [fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic] holds precisely because of the fact that &quot;prime&quot; is the same as &quot;irreducible&quot; in $\\mathbb{Z}$.',
