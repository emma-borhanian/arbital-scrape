  text: '&gt; To the extent we can set up all of these problems as parts of a learning problem, it just seems like an empirical question which ones will be hard, and how hard they will be. I think that you are wrong about this empirical question, and you think I am wrong, but perhaps we can agree that it is an empirical question?\n\nThe main thing I&#39;d be nervous about is having the difference in our opinions be testable before the mission-critical stage.  Like, maybe simple learning systems exhibit pathologies and you&#39;re like &quot;Oh that&#39;ll be fixed with sufficient predictive power&quot; and I say &quot;Even if you&#39;re right, I&#39;m not sure the world doesn&#39;t end before then.&quot;  Or conversely, maybe toy models seem to learn the concept perfectly and I&#39;m like &quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;re using a test set that&#39;s an identical set of problems to the training set&quot; and you&#39;re like &quot;That&#39;s a pretty good model for how I think superhuman intelligence would also go, because it would be able to generalize better over the greater differences&quot; and I&#39;m like &quot;But you&#39;re not testing the mission-critical part of the assumption.&quot;\n\n&gt; The historical track record for hand-coding vs. learning is not good. For example, even probabilistic reasoning seems at this point like it&#39;s something that our agents should learn on their own (to the extent that probability is relevant to ML, it is increasingly as a technique relevant to analyzing ML systems rather than as a hard-coded feature of their reasoning).\n\nWe might have an empirical disagreement about to what extent theory plays a role in practice in ML, but I suspect we also have a policy disagreement about how important transparency is in practice to success - i.e., how likely we are to die like squirrels if we try to use a system whose desired/required dynamics we don&#39;t understand on an abstract level.\n\n&gt; So it seems natural to first make sure that everything can be attacked as a learning problem, before trying to solve a bunch of particular learning problems by hand.\n\nI&#39;m not against trying both approaches in parallel.\n',
