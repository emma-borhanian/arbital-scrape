  text: 'It seems critical to distinguish the cases where\n\n1. We are hoping the AI generalizes the concept of &quot;burrito&quot; in the intended way to new data,\n2. The definition of burrito is &quot;something our burrito-identifier would identify as a burrito given enough time,&quot; and we are just hoping the AI doesn&#39;t make mistakes. (The burrito-identifier is some process that we can actually run in order to determine whether something is a burrito.)\n\nAs you&#39;ve probably gathered, I feel hopeless about case (1).\n\nIn case (2), any agent that can learn the concept &quot;definitely a burrito&quot; could use this concept to produce definitely-burritos and thereby achieve high reward in the RL game. So the mere existence of the easy-to-learn definitely-a-burrito concept seems to imply that our learner will behave well. We don&#39;t have to actually explicitly do any work about conservative concepts (except to better understand the behavior of our learner).\n\nI&#39;ve never managed to get quite clear on your picture. My impression is that:\n\n*  you think that case (2) is doomed because there is no realistic prospect for creating a good enough burrito-evaluator, \n* you think that even with a good enough burrito-evaluator, you would still have serious trouble because of errors.\n\nI think your optimism about case (1) is defensible; I disagree, but not for super straightforward reasons.  The main disagreement is probably about case (2).\n\nI think that your concern about generating a good enough burrito-evaluator is also defensible; I am optimistic, but even on my view this would require resolving a number of big research problems.\n\nI think your concern about mistakes, and especially about something like &quot;conservative concepts&quot; as a way to reduce the scope for mistakes, is less defensible. I don&#39;t feel like this is as complex an issue---the case for delegating this to the learning algorithm seems quite strong, and I don&#39;t feel you&#39;ve really given a case on the other side.\n\nNote that this is related to what you&#39;ve been calling [4w], and I do think that there are techniques in that space that could help avoid mistakes. (Though I would definitely frame that problem differently.) So it&#39;s possible we&#39;re not really disagreeing here either. But my best guess is that you are underestimating to the extent to which some of these issues could/should be delegated to the learner itself, supposing that we could resolve your other concerns (i.e. supposing that we could construct a good enough burrito-evaluator).',
