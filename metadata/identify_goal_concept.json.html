  text: '[summary:  The problem of communicating to an AI a very simple local concept on the order of &quot;strawberries&quot; or &quot;give me a strawberry&quot;.  This level of the problem is meant to include subproblems of local categorization like &quot;I meant a real strawberry like the ones I already showed you, not a fake strawberry that looks similar to your webcam&quot;.  It isn&#39;t meant to include larger problems like [2s3 verifying that a plan uses only known, whitelisted methods] or [6c identifying all possible harmful effects we could care about].]\n\nThe problem of trying to figure out how to communicate to an AGI an [6h intended] goal [ concept] on the order of &quot;give me a strawberry, and not a fake plastic strawberry either&quot;.\n\nAt this level of the problem, we&#39;re not concerned with e.g. larger problems of [2s3 safe plan identification] such as not mugging people for strawberries, or [2pf minimizing side effects].  We&#39;re not (at this level of the problem) concerned with identifying [6c each and every one of the components of human value], as they might be impacted by side effects more distant in the causal graph.  We&#39;re not concerned with [ philosophical uncertainty] about what we [normativity should] mean by &quot;strawberry&quot;.  We suppose that in an intuitive sense, we do have a pretty good idea of what we [6h intend] by &quot;strawberry&quot;, such that there are things that are definitely strawberries and we&#39;re pretty happy with our sense of that so long as nobody is deliberately trying to fool it.\n\nWe just want to communicate a *local* goal concept that distinguishes edible strawberries from plastic strawberries, or nontoxic strawberries from poisonous strawberries.  That is: we want to say &quot;strawberry&quot; in an understandable way that&#39;s suitable for fulfilling a [6w task] of &quot;just give Sally a strawberry&quot;, possibly in conjunction with other features like [2qp conservatism] or [2pf low impact] or [2r8 mild optimization].\n\nFor some open subproblems of the obvious approach that goes through showing actual strawberries to the AI&#39;s webcam, see &quot;[36w]&quot; and &quot;[2s0]&quot;.',
