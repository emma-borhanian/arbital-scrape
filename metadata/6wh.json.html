  text: 'My take on it: let&#39;s say you tell the other person you are running 10 minutes late. If you end up coming on time, then you get no social penalty for being not on-time (blue line at t=&quot;on time&quot;), but you get a social penalty for being off your stated mark (red U at t=&quot;on time&quot;). If you show up 10 minutes late, as you said you would, you get some social penalty for being late (blue line at t=&quot;10 mins late&quot;), but a *small amount* of social penalty from red U (at t=&quot;10 mins late&quot;) because you actually showed up when you said you would (i.e. 10 minutes later). The reason it&#39;s *small amount* and not zero is because you are still 10 minutes late from the original time. If you said you would be 9 minutes later, then U would be closer to x-axis; at 5 minutes, it would be presumably half as high from the x-axis; and if you said you were running on-time and showed up on-time, then it would be tangent to x-axis (and t=&quot;on time&quot; and t=&quot;reported ETA&quot; would be the same).\n\nOne thing that&#39;s a bit misleading is that earlier in the post Paul says: \n\n&gt; My total delay is the sum of two terms:  \n**Error**: How badly I messed up my departure time. If this term is large then it signals incompetence and disrespect.  \n**Noise**: How unlucky I got with respect to traffic (and other random factors). This doesnâ€™t really signal much.\n\nError is the blue line. Noise is the red U, but he still counts that as social penalty. I guess it just doesn&#39;t factor into &quot;signaling&quot;, meaning the other person might still be somewhat upset, but they won&#39;t take delay from noise as evidence about you.',
