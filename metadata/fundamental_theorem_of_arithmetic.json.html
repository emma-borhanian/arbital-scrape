  text: '[todo: make Number Theory a parent of this]\n\n[summary: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is a statement about the [45h natural numbers]; it says that every natural number may be decomposed as a product of [4mf primes], and this expression is unique up to reordering the factors. It is an extremely important theorem, and it is the basis of the field of [-number_theory].]\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every [-45h] (greater than or equal to $2$) may be expressed as a product of [4mf prime numbers], and the product is unique up to reordering.\n\nThis theorem is one of the main reasons $1$ is not considered to be prime: indeed, if it were prime then $3 \\times 5$ could be factorised into primes as $3 \\times 5 \\times 1$, but these would be two *different* factorisations of the number $15$.\nThe FTA&#39;s statement is much cleaner if $1$ is not thought of as prime.\n\nIn a more general context, the FTA says precisely that the [3gq ring] $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a [-unique_factorisation_domain]; there is therefore a much more abstract proof than the elementary one we will present further on in this article:\n\n- $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a [euclidean_domain Euclidean domain] (with Euclidean function given by &quot;take the modulus&quot;);\n- Therefore $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a [-5r5] ([euclidean_domain_is_pid proof]);\n- And principal ideal domains are unique factorisation domains ([principal_ideal_domain_has_unique_factorisation proof]).\n\n# Examples\n\n- The FTA does not talk about $0$ or $1$; this is because these numbers are conventionally considered neither prime nor composite.\n- Even if we haven&#39;t bothered to calculate $17 \\times 23 \\times 23$, we can immediately say that it is odd. Indeed, by the FTA, $2$ cannot divide $17 \\times 23^2$, because the complete list of prime factors of this number is $\\{ 17, 23, 23\\}$, and $2$ is prime.\n\n# Proof\n\nTimothy Gowers has an [excellent article](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/11/18/proving-the-fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic/) about the proof of the FTA.\n\nThe FTA consists of two parts: we must show that every number can be decomposed as primes, and also that every number can be decomposed *uniquely*.\n\n## Every number can be written as a product of primes\n\nThis part is the easier, and it uses [-strong_induction] (a version of [5fz proof by induction]).\n\nClearly $2$ can be written as a product of primes, because it *is* prime; so it can be written as just itself.\n\nNow, for $n$ bigger than $2$, if $n$ is prime then we are immediately done (just write it as itself).\nOtherwise, $n$ is not prime, so it can be written as $a \\times b$, say, with $a$ and $b$ both less than $n$.\n\nBut by the inductive hypothesis, we can express $a$ and $b$ each as products of primes, so we can express $n$ as the combined product of the two sets of factors of $a$ and $b$.\n\n%%hidden(Example):\nConsider $n = 1274$.\nWe have two options: $n$ is prime or $n$ is composite.\n\nIt turns out that $n$ is actually equal to $49 \\times 26$, so it&#39;s not prime.\n\nBy the inductive hypothesis, we can factor $49$ as a product of primes (indeed, it&#39;s $7^2$); and we can factor $26$ as a product of primes (indeed, it&#39;s $2 \\times 13$); so we can factor $1274$ as $2 \\times 7^2 \\times 13$.\n\n(If you like, you can view this as just &quot;start again at $49$ instead of at $1274$, and spit out what you get; then start again at $26$ instead of $1274$, and spit out what you get; and finally combine the spittings-out&quot;; no mention of a spooky &quot;inductive hypothesis&quot; at all.)\n\nNote that at this point, we haven&#39;t any guarantee at all that this is the *only* prime factorisation; all we assert so far is that it is *a* prime factorisation.\n%%\n\n## Every number can be decomposed *uniquely* as a product of primes\n\nFor this, we will need a basic (but non-obvious and important) fact about the behaviour of prime numbers: [5mh Euclid&#39;s lemma], which states that if a prime $p$ divides a product $ab$, then $p$ divides at least one of $a$ and $b$.\n\nWe will work by induction on $n$ again.\nIf $n = 2$ then the result is immediate: a number can only be divided by numbers which are not larger than it, but $1$ and $2$ are the only such numbers.\n\nSuppose $n$ can be written as both $p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$ and $q_1 q_2 \\dots q_s$, where each $p_i$ and $q_j$ is prime (but there might be repeats: maybe $p_1 = p_2 = q_3 = q_7$, for instance).\nWe need to show that $r=s$ and that (possibly after reordering the lists) $p_i = q_i$ for each $i$.\n\nCertainly $p_1$ divides $n$, because it divides $p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$.\nTherefore it divides $q_1 q_2 \\dots q_s$, and hence it divides one of $q_1$ or $q_2 \\dots q_s$, by Euclid&#39;s lemma.\nTherefore either it divides $q_1$, or it divides one of $q_2$ or $q_3 \\dots q_s$; by induction, $p_1$ divides some $q_i$.\nBecause we don&#39;t care about the ordering of the list, let us reorder the list if necessary so that in fact $i=1$: put the factor $q_i$ at the start of the list.\n\nNow, $q_1$ is prime, and $p_1$ is not equal to $1$ but it divides $q_1$; hence $p_1 = q_1$.\n\nDividing through by $p_1$, then, we obtain $p_2 \\dots p_r = q_2 \\dots q_s$, a strictly smaller number; so by the inductive hypothesis, $r-1 = s-1$ (so $r=s$) and the unordered list of $p_i$ is the same as the unordered list of $q_i$ for $i \\geq 2$.\n\nThis proves the theorem.\n\n# Why is this not obvious?\n\nTimothy Gowers has a [good piece](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/11/13/why-isnt-the-fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic-obvious/) on why this result is not just obvious.\nOf course, what is &quot;obvious&quot; and what is not &quot;obvious&quot; varies heavily depending on who you&#39;re talking to.\nFor this author personally, the true reason it&#39;s not obvious is Gowers&#39;s reason number 4: because there are very similar structures which do *not* have the property of unique factorisation.\n(Gowers uses $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$; on the [5m1 page on irreducibles], we show that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-3}]$ could be used just as well.)',
