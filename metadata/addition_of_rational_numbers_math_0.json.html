  text: '[summary: Addition is &quot;putting two quantities next to each other and working out how much they come to when combined&quot;.]\n\nWe&#39;ve already met the idea that rational numbers are what we can make by putting together the building blocks which we get by dividing a single apple into some number of equally-sized pieces; and remember that the building blocks have a special notation, as $\\frac{1}{\\text{number}}$.\nRecall also that if we take $5$ of a certain building block, for instance, we write $\\frac{5}{\\text{number}}$.\n\nIt&#39;s clear that if you take one apple and another apple, and put them together, you&#39;ll get two apples.\nSo we should hope that that&#39;s the same if we divided up the apples into pieces first (without removing any of the pieces).\n\nWe write $a+b$ for &quot;take the rational number $a$ and put it next to the rational number $b$, and count up what you&#39;ve got&quot;.\nBecause I&#39;m bad at drawing, we&#39;ll pretend apples are just perfect circles. %%note:This is actually a design decision: eventually we&#39;ll want to get away from considering apples, and this more abstract representation will be useful.%%\n\n![Example of a sum of two rational numbers](http://i.imgur.com/GUgmCwb.png)\n\n----------\n\n\nFor example, we should hope that $\\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{3}{3} = 2$.\n\n![Two halves and three thirds](http://i.imgur.com/6vdRdcT.png)\n\nWhat about in cases which aren&#39;t of the form $\\frac{n}{n}$ for some integer $n$?\nWell, how about $\\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n![Five thirds and eight thirds](http://i.imgur.com/7dPqmCP.png)\n\nIf we had five $\\frac{1}{3}$-blocks, and we put them together with another eight $\\frac{1}{3}$-blocks, we would hope to have $5+8=13$ blocks.\nSo we should hope that $\\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{13}{3}$.\n\n![Thirds, separated out](http://i.imgur.com/foVkEiS.png)\n\nAnd in general, if both our quantities are made up from the same size of building-block (in the above case, the blocks are $\\frac{1}{3}$-sized), we should just be able to take the two numerators %%note:Remember, that was the word mathematicians use for the number of blocks we have.%% and add them together.\n\n----------\n\nVery well. But what if the two quantities are not made up from the same size of building-block? That is, the denominators are different?\nFor example, $\\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{5}{4}$?\n\n![Five thirds and five quarters](http://i.imgur.com/xFtKEnU.png)\n\n![Five thirds and five quarters, rearranged](http://i.imgur.com/Av984T0.png)\n\nNow it&#39;s not so clear.\nHow might we approach this? You should muse on this for thirty seconds before reading on; it will be good for your soul.\n\n%%hidden(Show solution):\nThe way we do it is to find some *smaller* block-size, out of which we can make *both* building-blocks.\n%%\n\n# Example\n\nOur example is $\\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{5}{4}$.\nSo we want to make the $\\frac{1}{3}$ block and the $\\frac{1}{4}$ block out of some smaller block.\n\nNow, I won&#39;t tell you yet how I got this, but you can check for yourself that $\\frac{1}{12}$-blocks will make both $\\frac{1}{3}$- and $\\frac{1}{4}$-blocks: because three $\\frac{1}{12}$-blocks together make something the same size as a $\\frac{1}{4}$-block, and four $\\frac{1}{12}$-blocks together make something the same size as a $\\frac{1}{3}$-block.\n\n![Thirds, divided into twelfths](http://i.imgur.com/k2iz8uR.png)\n\n![Quarters, divided into twelfths](http://i.imgur.com/gmHK3oj.png)\n\nTherefore $\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{12}$:\n\n![One third, divided into twelfths](http://i.imgur.com/fFX4Dmc.png)\n\nAnd $\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{12}$:\n\n![One quarter, divided into twelfths](http://i.imgur.com/gRqmfAc.png)\n\nNow, if $\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{12}$ - that is, if one $\\frac{1}{3}$-piece is the same size as four $\\frac{1}{12}$-pieces - then it should be the case that five $\\frac{1}{3}$-pieces come to five lots of four $\\frac{1}{12}$-pieces.\nThat is, to twenty $\\frac{1}{12}$-pieces: $\\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{20}{12}$.\n[todo: picture which I haven&#39;t got round to detailing yet]\n\nSimilarly, $\\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{15}{12}$, because five $\\frac{1}{4}$-pieces is the same as five lots of three sets of $\\frac{1}{12}$-pieces, and $5 \\times 3 = 15$.\n\nTherefore $\\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{5}{4}$ should be just the same as $\\frac{20}{12} + \\frac{15}{12}$, which we know how to calculate!\nIt is $\\frac{35}{12}$.\n\n# General procedure\n\nThe preceding example might suggest a general way for adding two fractions together. (In the process, this should put to rest the existential dread mentioned in [4zx the intro to rational numbers], about whether it makes sense to add two rational numbers at all.)\n\nThe general procedure is as follows:\n\n 1. Find a building-block size such that the building-blocks of both fractions can be made out of that building-block\n 2. Express each fraction individually in terms of that building-block\n 3. Add the two together (which we can now do, because they are both made of the same size of building-block).\n\nThe interesting part is really the first step.\n\n## Finding a building-block that will neatly make two other differently-sized blocks\n\nLet&#39;s be concrete here: just as above, we showed that $\\frac{1}{12}$ works for blocks of size $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$, so we&#39;ll now consider $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nWe&#39;re trying to divide up $\\frac{1}{2}$ into copies of a smaller building-block, such that with copies of that *same* building block, we can also make $\\frac{1}{5}$.\nHere is the key insight that tells us how to do it: let us pretend that we are dividing up the *same* object, this time a square instead of a circle, into two pieces along one edge and into five pieces along the other edge.\nHow many pieces have we made?\n\n![Square divided into tenths](http://i.imgur.com/qkMkQvZ.png)\n\nThere are $2 \\times 5 = 10$ pieces, each of them the same size (namely the $\\frac{1}{10}$-block size), and note that as if by magic we&#39;ve just produced a way to subdivide $\\frac{1}{2}$ into pieces made up of the $\\frac{1}{10}$-block!\n\n![Square divided into tenths, one half indicated](http://i.imgur.com/n9dYZBA.png)\n\nAnd we also have the $\\frac{1}{5}$ subdivided in the same way!\n\n![Square divided into tenths, one fifth indicated](http://i.imgur.com/0ny9RnS.png)\n\nThis might suggest a general way to do this; you should certainly ponder for thirty seconds before continuing.\n%%hidden(Show the general way):\n[todo: find a way to do this without algebra]\nLet&#39;s say we are trying to make both $\\frac{1}{m}$ and $\\frac{1}{n}$-sized blocks out of smaller blocks.\n(So above, $m$ is standing for $2$ and $n$ is standing for $5$.)\n\nThen we can do this by splitting both up into $\\frac{1}{m \\times n}$-blocks.\n\nIndeed, $\\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{m}{m \\times n}$ (i.e. we can make a $\\frac{1}{n}$-block out of $m$ of the $\\frac{1}{m \\times n}$ tiny-blocks),\nand $\\frac{1}{m} = \\frac{n}{m \\times n}$ (i.e. we can make a $\\frac{1}{m}$-block out of $n$ of the $\\frac{1}{m \\times n}$ tiny-blocks).\n%%\n\n## Aside: arithmetical rules\n\nThe description of the &quot;general way&quot; above has become pretty full of $\\frac{1}{\\text{thing}}$, and refers less and less to the building-blocks we originally considered.\nThe reason for this is that $\\frac{1}{\\text{thing}}$ is an extremely convenient shorthand, and the &quot;general way&quot; can be written as a very simple rule for manipulating that shorthand.\nOnce we have such a convenient rule, we can compute with fractions without having to go through the bother of working out what each fraction really and truly *means* (in terms of the building-blocks); this saves a lot of time in practice.\nAs an analogy, it&#39;s easier for you to drive a car if, every time you change gears, you *don&#39;t* have to work out what&#39;s happening inside the gearbox.\n\nThe simple rule we have just seen is $$\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{n}{m \\times n} + \\frac{m}{m \\times n}$$\nAnd we&#39;ve already had the rule that $$\\frac{a}{m} + \\frac{b}{m} = \\frac{a+b}{m}$$\n(Remember, if these are not obvious to you, you should think back to what they really mean, in terms of the building-blocks. The first rule is to do with dividing up a big square into little squares, from the previous subsection; the second rule is just taking two collections of building-blocks of the same size and putting them together.)\n[todo: first rule has picture: square divided into n-by-m little squares, with the leftmost vertical column highlighted somehow, indicating that 1/n = m/(mn); second rule has picture: $a$ things of size 1/m, next to $b$ things of size 1/m]\n\nThis is almost every rule we need to add any pair of fractions!\nWe can now add single building blocks of any size together.\n\nTo add any pair of rational numbers together - say of building-block size $\\frac{1}{m}$ and $\\frac{1}{n}$ respectively - we just need to express them each in terms of the smaller building-block $\\frac{1}{m \\times n}$, and add them together as normal.\n\n%%hidden(Example):\nEarlier, we considered $\\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nA building-block which can make both the $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$-sized blocks is the $\\frac{1}{12}$-block, because $3 \\times 4 = 12$.\n\nTherefore we need to express both our fractions as being made from $\\frac{1}{12}$-sized blocks.\n\n$\\frac{5}{4}$ is $\\frac{15}{12}$, because in each of the five $\\frac{1}{4}$-blocks, there are three $\\frac{1}{12}$-blocks, so we have a total of $5 \\times 3$ blocks of size $\\frac{1}{12}$.\n\n$\\frac{5}{3}$ is $\\frac{20}{12}$, because in each of the five $\\frac{1}{3}$-blocks, there are four $\\frac{1}{12}$-blocks, so we have a total of $5 \\times 4 = 20$ blocks of size $\\frac{1}{12}$.\n\nTherefore our final answer is $\\frac{15}{12} + \\frac{20}{12} = \\frac{35}{12}$.\n%%\n\nTo make this into a general rule: $$\\frac{a}{m} + \\frac{b}{n} = \\frac{a \\times n}{m \\times n} + \\frac{b \\times m}{m \\times n} = \\frac{a \\times n + b \\times m}{m \\times n}$$\n\n(Recall the order of operations in the integers: the notation $a \\times n + b \\times m$ means &quot;do $a \\times n$; then do $b \\times m$; then finally add them together&quot;. Multiplication comes before addition.)\n\nAnd that&#39;s it! That&#39;s how we add rational numbers together, and it works even when any or all of $a, b, m, n$ are negative.\n(Remember, though, that $m$ and $n$ can&#39;t be zero, because it makes no sense to divide something up into no pieces.)\n\nIt would be wise now to try the [55p exercises]. One learns mathematics through doing, much more than through simply reading; your understanding will be cemented by going through some concrete examples.',
