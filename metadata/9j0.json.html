  text: 'This &quot;argument&quot; by the &quot;scientist&quot; doesn&#39;t IMO represent how a true experimentalist would approach the issue; they would not necessarily be so opposed to trying new ways of improving their methods, as long as it is done step by step without replacing the entire system over night (just like the &quot;bayesian&quot; explains in the next paragraph).\n\nThis is also a bit side-tracking as it opens up the topic of how much more &quot;experience&quot; computer scientists have given the simpler and much more reproducible systems they&#39;re dealing with -- especially in the modern commercial world -- in contrast with natural sciences (I&#39;m a programmer myself, so I&#39;m a bit biased on this).',
