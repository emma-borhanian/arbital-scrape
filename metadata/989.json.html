  text: 'This (the ignoring of cost) seems like a flaw to Bayesian analysis, and makes me think there&#39;s probably some extension to it, which is being omitted here for simplicity, but which  takes into account something like cost, value, or utility.\n\nFor example, the &quot;cost&quot; of a bayesian filter deciding to show a salesman a spam email is far lower than the &quot;cost&quot; of the same filter deciding to prevent them from seeing an email from a million-dollar sales lead.\n\nSo, while the *calculation* of probabilities *should not* take into account cost, it feels like the *making decisions of based on* those probabilities *should* take cost into account.\n\nFor example: the chances of our getting wiped out in the near future by a natural disaster. Yet, the potential consequences are dire, and the net costs per person of detection are low, or even negative. Therefore, we have a global near-earth-object detection network, a tsunami and quake detection network, fire watch towers, weather and climate monitors, disease tracking centers, and so on.\n\nIf this extension to Bayesian analysis exists, this seem a sensible place to link to it.',
