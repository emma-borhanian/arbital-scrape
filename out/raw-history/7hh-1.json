Why is that *necessarily* the best way of making decisions, no matter what the circumstances?  Why would an Artificial Intelligence care what's academically popular?  Maybe there's some better way of thinking about general agents?  Heck, why is this formalism popular in the first place?\n\nWe can ask the same question about [1bv probability theory].  Okay, we have this mathematical formalism in which the chance that X happens ($\\mathbb P(X)$), plus the chance that X doesn't happen ($\\mathbb P(\\neg X)$), must be represented in a way that makes the two numbers sum to one ($\\mathbb P(X) + \\mathbb P(\\neg X) = 1$).  That formalism may have some neat mathematical properties, but so what?  Why should the best way of reasoning about chances have neat properties like that?  Why shouldn't an agent reason about chances using something completely unlike probabilities?  \"How do you *know* an AI would reason in probabilities?\" you ask. \"You haven't seen an AI.  So what do you think you know and how do you think you know it?\"\n\nThis entirely valid question is what this introduction tries to answer.  There are, indeed, reasons beyond academic habit and mathematical convenience for why we would by default invoke 'expected utility' and 'probability theory' to think about good human decisions or sufficiently advanced AIs.\n\nThe general form of the answer seems easier to show than to tell, so we'll just plunge straight in.\n\n# Why not circular preferences?\n\n*De gustibus non est disputandum,* goes the proverb; matters of taste cannot be disputed.  If I like onions on my pizza and you like pineapple, it's not that one of us is right and one of us is wrong.  We just prefer different pizza toppings.\n\nWell, but suppose I declare to you that I *simultaneously*:\n\n- Prefer onions to pineapple on my pizza.\n- Prefer pineapple to mushrooms on my pizza.\n- Prefer mushrooms to onions on my pizza.\n\nIf we use $>_P$ to denote my pizza preferences, with $X >_P Y$ denoting that I prefer X to Y, then I am declaring:\n\n$$\\text{onions} >_P \\text{pineapple} >_P \\text{mushrooms} >_P \\text{onions}$$\n\nThat sounds strange, to be sure.  But is there anything *wrong* with that?\n\nWe did use the math symbol $>$ which denotes an ordering.  If we ask whether $>_P$ can be a standard ordering, it naughtily violates the transitivity axiom $x > y, y > z \\implies x > z$.  Okay, so then maybe we shouldn't have used the symbol $>_P$ or called it an ordering.  But why is that necessarily bad?\n\nIf we imagine each pizza as having a numerical score denoting how much I like it, there's no way we could assign consistent numbers to those three pizza toppings that would yield those three preferences.  Okay, but maybe I don't assign numbers to my pizza.  Why is that so wrong?\n\nAre there any grounds besides \"we like a certain mathematical formalism and your choices can't fit into that math,\" on which criticize my three simultaneous preferences?\n\n(Feel free to try to answer this yourself before continuing...)\n\n%%hidden(Click here to reveal the author's answer):\nGenerally speaking, when people express a preference, we imagine that they'd be willing to go to at least a little effort to achieve that preference.\n\nSuppose I tell you that I prefer pineapple to mushrooms on my pizza.  Suppose you're about to give me a slice of mushroom pizza; but by paying one penny ($\\$0.01$) I can instead get a slice of pineapple pizza (which is just as fresh from the oven). It seems realistic to say that most people with a pineapple pizza preference would probably pay the penny, if they happened to have a penny in their pocket. %note: It could be that somebody's pizza preference is real, but so weak that they wouldn't pay one penny to get the pizza they prefer.  In this case, imagine we're talking about some stronger preference instead.  Like your willingness to pay at least one penny not to have your house burned down, or something.%\n\nAfter I pay the penny, though, and just before I'm about to get the pineapple pizza, you offer me a slice of onion pizza instead--no charge, this time!  If I was telling the truth about preferring onion pizza to pineapple, I should certainly accept the substitution if it's free.\n\nAnd then to round out the day, you offer me a mushroom pizza instead of the onion pizza, and again, since I prefer mushrooms to onions, I accept the swap.\n\nI end up with exactly the same slice of mushroom pizza I started with... and one penny poorer, because I previously paid \\$0.01 to swap mushrooms for pineapple.\n%%\n\nThis seems like a *qualitatively* bad behavior on my part.  By virtue of my incoherent preferences which cannot be given a consistent ordering, I have shot myself in the foot, done something self-defeating.  We haven't said *how* I ought to sort out my inconsistent preferences.  But no matter how it shakes out, it seems like there must be *some* better alternative--some better way I could reason that wouldn't spend a penny to go in circles.  That is, I could at least have kept my original pizza slice and not spent the penny.\n\nIn a phrase you're going to hear a lot more of later, I have executed a 'dominated strategy' in the sense that there must exist some other strategy that does strictly better. %note: This does assume that the agent prefers to have more money rather than less money.  \"Ah, but why is it bad if one person has a penny instead of another?\" you ask.  If we insist on pinning down every point of this sort, then you can also imagine the $\\$0.01$ as standing in for the *time* I burned in order to move the pizza slices around in circles.  That time was burned, and nobody else has it now.  If I'm an effective agent that goes around pursuing my preferences, I should in general be able to sometimes convert time into other things that I want.  In other words, my circular preference can lead me to incur an [ opportunity cost] denominated in the sacrifice of other things I want, and not in a way that benefits anyone else.%\n\nOr as Steve Omohundro put it:  If you prefer being in Berkeley to being in San Francisco; prefer being in San Jose to being in Berkeley; and prefer being in San Francisco to being in San Jose; then you're going to waste a lot of time on taxi rides.\n\nNone of this reasoning has told us that a non-self-defeating agent must prefer Berkeley to San Francisco or vice versa.  There are six possible consistent orderings over pizza toppings, like $\\text{mushroom} >_P \\text{pineapple} >_P \\text{onion}$ etcetera, and any of those six would avoid paying to go in circles. %note: Actually there are more than six possibilities, because we can also be indifferent between two kinds of pizza.%  We have not, at least in this argument, used pure logic to derive a priori that pineapple pizza must taste better than mushroom pizza.  But we've seen that eliminating a certain kind of self-defeating (strictly dominated) behavior, corresponds to imposing a certain *coherence* or *consistency* requirement on whatever preferences are there.\n\nIt turns out that this is one relatively simple instance of a large family of *coherence theorems* which all end up pointing at the same set of core properties.  All roads lead to Rome, and all the roads say, \"If you are not shooting yourself in the foot in sense X, we can view you as having coherence property Y.\"\n\nAs one might expect, there are a number of caveats to this general idea.  On complicated problems, perfect coherence is often pragmatically impossible to compute--it's just too expensive to execute an ideal Bayesian update on all the hypotheses, or whatever.  But even then, there may be bounded versions of the same argument.  If, say, there's a powerful machine intelligence that is not *visibly to us humans* shooting itself in the foot in way X, then *from our perspective* it must look like it could have coherence property Y for all *we* can tell.  In which case it may make sense, from our perspective, to think about the machine intelligence as if it has a utility function, or whatever.\n\nWe are not going to go through all the coherence theorems in this introduction.  They form a big family, some of them are a lot more mathematically intimidating, and let's be honest, there may not be anyone on Earth who knows literally all of them.\n\nBut we can walk through enough coherence theorems to at least get an idea of \"Why expected utility?\"  And, because the two are a bit of a package deal, \"Why probability?\"\n\n# Human lives, mere dollars, and coherent trades\n\nAn experiment in 2000--from a paper titled \"[The Psychology of the Unthinkable:\nTaboo Trade-Offs, Forbidden Base Rates, and Heretical Counterfactuals](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jenniferlerner/files/2000_the_psychology_of_the_unthinkable.pdf?m=145089665)\"--asked subjects to consider the dilemma of a hospital administrator named Robert:\n\n> Robert can save the life of Johnny, a five year old who needs a liver transplant, but the transplant procedure will cost the hospital \\$1,000,000 that could be spent in other ways, such as purchasing better equipment and enhancing salaries to recruit talented doctors to the hospital. Johnny is very ill and has been on the waiting list for a transplant but because of the shortage of local organ donors, obtaining a liver will be expensive. Robert could save Johnny's life, or he could use the \\$1,000,000 for other hospital needs.\n\nThe main experimental result was that subjects were angry at Robert for even considering the question and wanted to punish him for having to think about it.\n\nAfter all, you can't put a dollar value on a human life, right?\n\nBut wait: better equipment also saves lives, or at least one hopes so. %note: We can omit the 'better doctors' item from consideration:  The supply of doctors is mostly constrained by regulatory burdens and medical schools rather than the number of people who want to become doctors; so bidding up salaries for doctors doesn't much increase the total number of doctors; so bidding on a talented doctor at one hospital just means some other hospital doesn't get that talented doctor. It's also illegal to pay for livers, but let's ignore that particular issue with the problem setup or pretend that it all takes place in a more sensible country than the United States or Europe.%  It's not like the other use of the money has no effect on saving lives, it's just more diffuse.\n\nLet's say that Robert has a total budget of \\$100,000,000 and is faced with a long list of options like these:\n\n- \\$100,000 for a new dialysis machine, which will save 3 lives\n- \\$1,000,000 for a liver for Johnny, which will save 1 life\n- \\$10,000 to train the nurses on proper hygiene when inserting central lines, which will save an expected 100 lives\n- \\$1,500,000 to renovate the pharmacy thoroughly enough to save at least one life\n- ...\n\nNow suppose--this is an important supposition that we'll need for our theorem--that Robert *does not care at all about money,* not even a tiny bit; Robert *only* cares about maximizing the total number of lives saved.  Furthermore, we suppose for now--we can modify this later--that Robert cares about every life equally.\n\nIt follows that Robert must *behave as if* he assigns some consistent dollar value to saving a human life, in the sense that we can look down the long list of options that Robert took and didn't take, and say, \"Oh, Robert took all the options that saved more than 1 life per \\$500,000 and rejected all options that saved less than 1 life per \\$500,000; so Robert's behavior is *consistent* with his spending \\$500,000 per life.\"\n\nAlternatively, if we can't view Robert's behavior as being coherent in this sense--if we cannot make up *any* dollar value of a human life, such that Robert's choices are consistent with that dollar value--then it must be possible to move around the same amount of money in a way that saves more lives.\n\nSo if we start from the qualitative criterion, \"Robert must save as many lives as possible; it shouldn't be possible to move around the same money to save more lives\", we end up with the quantitative coherence theorem, \"It must be possible to view Robert as trading dollars for lives at some consistent price.\"\n\nAnd then the caveats and subtleties:\n\nWe haven't proven that dollars have some intrinsic worth that trades off against the intrinsic worth of a human life.  By hypothesis, Robert doesn't care about money at all.  It's just that every dollar has an *opportunity cost* in lives it could have saved if deployed differently; and this opportunity cost is the same for every dollar because money is fungible; and that implies a consistent trading rate between dollars and lives.\n\nWe haven't proven that there's some specific dollar value in Robert's head; we've only proven that Robert's behavior can be *viewed as if* it prices lives at *some* consistent value.  It could be the case, for example, that Robert accepts every option that spends less than \\$500,000/life and rejects every option that spends over \\$600,000 and there aren't any available options in the middle.  Then Robert's behavior can equally be viewed as consistent with a price of \\$510,000 or a price of \\$590,000.  Maybe Robert himself never lets himself think a specific threshold value, because it would be Wrong to assign a dollar value to human life, and instead Robert just fiddles the money until he can't save any more lives.  Coherence theorems aren't about psychology--they aren't about how agents think or compute their actions--they're about the actions themselves.\n\nWe have not proved ab initio by pure logic that Robert must want, in the first place, to save as many lives as possible.  Maybe Robert values a 10-year-old's life at 5 times the value of a 70-year-old's life, so that Robert will sacrifice five grandparents to save one 10-year-old.\n\nHm!  Let's consider that last possibility more thoroughly.  If Robert considers a preteen equally valuable with 5 grandparents, so that Robert will shift \\$100,000 from saving 8 old people to saving 2 children, then Robert *shouldn't* be saving as many lives as possible.  That last decision would decrease by 6 the total number of lives saved.  So we can no longer say that there's a qualitative criterion, 'Save as many lives as possible', that produces the quantitative coherence requirement, 'trade dollars for lives at a consistent rate'.\n\nDoes this mean that Robert's behavior might as well go out the window, so far as coherence is concerned?  Anything goes, now?  Just spend money wherever?\n\n\"Hm,\" you might think again.  \"But... if Robert trades 8 old people for 2 children *here*... and then trades 1 child for 2 old people *here*...\"\n\nBut now this is getting needlessly disturbing, so let's make it about apples and oranges instead.\n\n- Alice starts with 8 apples and 1 orange.\n- Then Alice trades 8 apples for 2 oranges.\n- Then Alice trades away 1 orange for 2 apples.\n- Finally, Alice trades another orange for 3 apples.\n\nThen Alice is using a strategy that's strictly dominated across categories of fruit.  She ends up with 5 apples and one orange, but could've had 8 apples and one orange by just not making any trades.  Regardless of the *relative* value of apples and oranges, the strategy is still doing strictly worse than another strategy, if the fruit have any positive value at all.\n\nSo the fact that Alice can't be seen as having any coherent relative value for apples and oranges, corresponds to her ending up with qualitatively less fruit across all categories.\n\nSimilarly--shifting our attention back to Robert for a moment--*either* we can view Robert as consistently assigning some relative value of life for 10-year-olds vs. 70-year-olds, *or* there must be a way to rearrange Robert's expenditures to save strictly more 10-year-olds or strictly more 70-year-olds.\n\nThen since this relative value is consistent, we can indeed go around saying, \"Robert is behaving as if one 10-year-old is worth five 70-year-olds\", and if we *can't* say anything like this, then there's some way to move around Robert's money and save more people across every category.\n\nAnd since the same logic applies to 50-year-olds, we must be able to say, \"Well, Robert is behaving as if a 50-year-old is worth 0.3 10-year-olds and a 70-year-old is worth 0.2 10-year-olds\", or something like that, on pain of Robert behaving in a way that qualitatively discards some lives he could have saved. \n\nOr perhaps Robert is just behaving in a way which implies that some 10-year-olds are worth more than others... but then *those* relative values need to be viewable as quantitatively coherent, or again, Robert must be qualitatively discarding some of what he said he would protect.\n\nGeneralizing this idea further:  If we can consistently view any agent as ending up with as much as is qualitatively possible of *anything*, whatever that agent says it values, however the agent says it says it values some things more than others... the agent must be behaving in a way consistent with it assigning all the things *coherent relative values.*\n\nAnd since you can denominate apples in oranges, and price oranges in pears, and trade off pears for apples at consistent rates, you might as well factor out a completely abstract unit for ease of notation.\n\nLet's call this unit... *1 utilon,* and denote it &euro;1.\n\nIf we say that apples are worth &euro;0.5, oranges are worth &euro;1.0, and pears are worth &euro;1.3, then this tells us the relative value of apples, oranges, and pears.  Conversely, if we *can* assign consistent relative values to apples, oranges, and pears, then we can factor out an arbitrary abstract unit at will--for example, by arbitrarily declaring apples to be worth &euro;10 and then pricing everything else in apples.\n\nHave we proven by pure logic that all apples have the same utility?  Of course not; you can prefer some particular apples to other particular apples and then they needn't have the same utility.  But when you're done saying which things you qualitatively prefer to which other things, if you go around making tradeoffs in way that can be *viewed as* not qualitatively leaving behind some things you said you wanted, we can *view you* as assigning coherent quantitative utilities to everything you want.\n\nAnd that's one coherence theorem--among others--that can be seen as motivating the concept of *utility* in decision theory.\n\nUtility isn't a solid thing, a separate thing.  We could multiply all the utilities by two, and that would correspond to all the same outward behaviors.  It's meaningless to ask how much utility you got at the end of your life, because we could subtract a million or add a million to that quantity while leaving all everything conceptually the same.\n\nIndeed, you could pick anything you valued--say, the joy of watching a cat chase a laser pointer for 10 seconds--and denominate everything relative to that, without needing any concept of a separate extra utility.  So just to be clear and to avoid any possible confusion, this philosophy does not say that there is a separate thing 'utility' which you should be pursuing *instead of* everything else you wanted in life.\n\nAnd of course this coherence theorem says nothing about which things to value or how much to value them relative to other things, any more than the notion of a coherently transitive preference ordering $>_P$ tells us whether onions $>_P$ pineapple.\n\n(And if you had the notion that 'utility' had something to do with assigning equal value to all human lives, or equal value to all sentient lives, or equal value to all Quality-Adjusted Life Years... then, our apologies, but that's *utilitarianism* which is ]a whole 'nother separate philosophy.  Sorry!)\n\nThe conceptual thingy that maps thingies or outcomes to utilities--the conceptual object that takes in a thingy and spits out a utility--is a 'utility function'.  Again, this isn't something that's written in stone somewhere, or even explicitly written inside your mind.  If we multiply the utility function by 9.2, that's conceptually the same utility function because it's still consistent with the same set of behaviors.\n\n# Probabilities and expected utility\n\nWe've so far made no mention of *probability.*  But the way that probabilities and utilities interact, is where we start to see the full structure that all the coherence theorems point to; and it is where we get the idea of 'expected utility' in the formal sense of a probabilistic expectation.\n\n(Work in progress.

Why is that *necessarily* the best way of making decisions, no matter what the circumstances?  Why would an Artificial Intelligence care what's academically popular?  Maybe there's some better way of thinking about general agents?  Heck, why is this formalism popular in the first place?\n\nWe can ask the same question about [1bv probability theory].  Okay, we have this mathematical formalism in which the chance that X happens ($\\mathbb P(X)$), plus the chance that X doesn't happen ($\\mathbb P(\\neg X)$), must be represented in a way that makes the two numbers sum to one ($\\mathbb P(X) + \\mathbb P(\\neg X) = 1$).  That formalism may have some neat mathematical properties, but so what?  Why should the best way of reasoning about chances have neat properties like that?  Why shouldn't an agent reason about chances using something completely unlike probabilities?  \"How do you *know* an AI would reason in probabilities?\" you ask. \"You haven't seen an AI.  So what do you think you know and how do you think you know it?\"\n\nThis entirely valid question is what this introduction tries to answer.  There are, indeed, reasons beyond academic habit and mathematical convenience for why we would by default invoke 'expected utility' and 'probability theory' to think about good human decisions or sufficiently advanced AIs.\n\nThe general form of the answer seems easier to show than to tell, so we'll just plunge straight in.\n\n# Why not circular preferences?\n\n*De gustibus non est disputandum,* goes the proverb; matters of taste cannot be disputed.  If I like onions on my pizza and you like pineapple, it's not that one of us is right and one of us is wrong.  We just prefer different pizza toppings.\n\nWell, but suppose I declare to you that I *simultaneously*:\n\n- Prefer onions to pineapple on my pizza.\n- Prefer pineapple to mushrooms on my pizza.\n- Prefer mushrooms to onions on my pizza.\n\nIf we use $>_P$ to denote my pizza preferences, with $X >_P Y$ denoting that I prefer X to Y, then I am declaring:\n\n$$\\text{onions} >_P \\text{pineapple} >_P \\text{mushrooms} >_P \\text{onions}$$\n\nThat sounds strange, to be sure.  But is there anything *wrong* with that?\n\nWe did use the math symbol $>$ which denotes an ordering.  If we ask whether $>_P$ can be a standard ordering, it naughtily violates the transitivity axiom $x > y, y > z \\implies x > z$.  Okay, so then maybe we shouldn't have used the symbol $>_P$ or called it an ordering.  But why is that necessarily bad?\n\nIf we imagine each pizza as having a numerical score denoting how much I like it, there's no way we could assign consistent numbers to those three pizza toppings that would yield those three preferences.  Okay, but maybe I don't assign numbers to my pizza.  Why is that so wrong?\n\nAre there any grounds besides \"we like a certain mathematical formalism and your choices can't fit into that math,\" on which criticize my three simultaneous preferences?\n\n(Feel free to try to answer this yourself before continuing...)\n\n%%hidden(Click here to reveal the author's answer):\nGenerally speaking, when people express a preference, we imagine that they'd be willing to go to at least a little effort to achieve that preference.\n\nSuppose I tell you that I prefer pineapple to mushrooms on my pizza.  Suppose you're about to give me a slice of mushroom pizza; but by paying one penny ($\\$0.01$) I can instead get a slice of pineapple pizza (which is just as fresh from the oven). It seems realistic to say that most people with a pineapple pizza preference would probably pay the penny, if they happened to have a penny in their pocket. %note: It could be that somebody's pizza preference is real, but so weak that they wouldn't pay one penny to get the pizza they prefer.  In this case, imagine we're talking about some stronger preference instead.  Like your willingness to pay at least one penny not to have your house burned down, or something.%\n\nAfter I pay the penny, though, and just before I'm about to get the pineapple pizza, you offer me a slice of onion pizza instead--no charge, this time!  If I was telling the truth about preferring onion pizza to pineapple, I should certainly accept the substitution if it's free.\n\nAnd then to round out the day, you offer me a mushroom pizza instead of the onion pizza, and again, since I prefer mushrooms to onions, I accept the swap.\n\nI end up with exactly the same slice of mushroom pizza I started with... and one penny poorer, because I previously paid \\$0.01 to swap mushrooms for pineapple.\n%%\n\nThis seems like a *qualitatively* bad behavior on my part.  By virtue of my incoherent preferences which cannot be given a consistent ordering, I have shot myself in the foot, done something self-defeating.  We haven't said *how* I ought to sort out my inconsistent preferences.  But no matter how it shakes out, it seems like there must be *some* better alternative--some better way I could reason that wouldn't spend a penny to go in circles.  That is, I could at least have kept my original pizza slice and not spent the penny.\n\nIn a phrase you're going to hear a lot more of later, I have executed a 'dominated strategy' in the sense that there must exist some other strategy that does strictly better. %note: This does assume that the agent prefers to have more money rather than less money.  \"Ah, but why is it bad if one person has a penny instead of another?\" you ask.  If we insist on pinning down every point of this sort, then you can also imagine the $\\$0.01$ as standing in for the *time* I burned in order to move the pizza slices around in circles.  That time was burned, and nobody else has it now.  If I'm an effective agent that goes around pursuing my preferences, I should in general be able to sometimes convert time into other things that I want.  In other words, my circular preference can lead me to incur an [ opportunity cost] denominated in the sacrifice of other things I want, and not in a way that benefits anyone else.%\n\nOr as Steve Omohundro put it:  If you prefer being in Berkeley to being in San Francisco; prefer being in San Jose to being in Berkeley; and prefer being in San Francisco to being in San Jose; then you're going to waste a lot of time on taxi rides.\n\nNone of this reasoning has told us that a non-self-defeating agent must prefer Berkeley to San Francisco or vice versa.  There are six possible consistent orderings over pizza toppings, like $\\text{mushroom} >_P \\text{pineapple} >_P \\text{onion}$ etcetera, and any of those six would avoid paying to go in circles. %note: Actually there are more than six possibilities, because we can also be indifferent between two kinds of pizza.%  We have not, at least in this argument, used pure logic to derive a priori that pineapple pizza must taste better than mushroom pizza.  But we've seen that eliminating a certain kind of self-defeating (strictly dominated) behavior, corresponds to imposing a certain *coherence* or *consistency* requirement on whatever preferences are there.\n\nIt turns out that this is one relatively simple instance of a large family of *coherence theorems* which all end up pointing at the same set of core properties.  All roads lead to Rome, and all the roads say, \"If you are not shooting yourself in the foot in sense X, we can view you as having coherence property Y.\"\n\nAs one might expect, there are a number of caveats to this general idea.  On complicated problems, perfect coherence is often pragmatically impossible to compute--it's just too expensive to execute an ideal Bayesian update on all the hypotheses, or whatever.  But even then, there may be bounded versions of the same argument.  If, say, there's a powerful machine intelligence that is not *visibly to us humans* shooting itself in the foot in way X, then *from our perspective* it must look like it could have coherence property Y for all *we* can tell.  In which case it may make sense, from our perspective, to think about the machine intelligence as if it has a utility function, or whatever.\n\nWe are not going to go through all the coherence theorems in this introduction.  They form a big family, some of them are a lot more mathematically intimidating, and let's be honest, there may not be anyone on Earth who knows literally all of them.\n\nBut we can walk through enough coherence theorems to at least get an idea of \"Why expected utility?\"  And, because the two are a bit of a package deal, \"Why probability?\"\n\n# Human lives, mere dollars, and coherent trades\n\nAn experiment in 2000--from a paper titled \"[The Psychology of the Unthinkable:\nTaboo Trade-Offs, Forbidden Base Rates, and Heretical Counterfactuals](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jenniferlerner/files/2000_the_psychology_of_the_unthinkable.pdf?m=145089665)\"--asked subjects to consider the dilemma of a hospital administrator named Robert:\n\n> Robert can save the life of Johnny, a five year old who needs a liver transplant, but the transplant procedure will cost the hospital \\$1,000,000 that could be spent in other ways, such as purchasing better equipment and enhancing salaries to recruit talented doctors to the hospital. Johnny is very ill and has been on the waiting list for a transplant but because of the shortage of local organ donors, obtaining a liver will be expensive. Robert could save Johnny's life, or he could use the \\$1,000,000 for other hospital needs.\n\nThe main experimental result was that subjects were angry at Robert for even considering the question and wanted to punish him for having to think about it.\n\nAfter all, you can't put a dollar value on a human life, right?\n\nBut wait: better equipment also saves lives, or at least one hopes so. %note: We can omit the 'better doctors' item from consideration:  The supply of doctors is mostly constrained by regulatory burdens and medical schools rather than the number of people who want to become doctors; so bidding up salaries for doctors doesn't much increase the total number of doctors; so bidding on a talented doctor at one hospital just means some other hospital doesn't get that talented doctor. It's also illegal to pay for livers, but let's ignore that particular issue with the problem setup or pretend that it all takes place in a more sensible country than the United States or Europe.%  It's not like the other use of the money has no effect on saving lives, it's just more diffuse.\n\nLet's say that Robert has a total budget of \\$100,000,000 and is faced with a long list of options like these:\n\n- \\$100,000 for a new dialysis machine, which will save 3 lives\n- \\$1,000,000 for a liver for Johnny, which will save 1 life\n- \\$10,000 to train the nurses on proper hygiene when inserting central lines, which will save an expected 100 lives\n- \\$1,500,000 to renovate the pharmacy thoroughly enough to save at least one life\n- ...\n\nNow suppose--this is an important supposition that we'll need for our theorem--that Robert *does not care at all about money,* not even a tiny bit; Robert *only* cares about maximizing the total number of lives saved.  Furthermore, we suppose for now--we can modify this later--that Robert cares about every life equally.\n\nIt follows that Robert must *behave as if* he assigns some consistent dollar value to saving a human life, in the sense that we can look down the long list of options that Robert took and didn't take, and say, \"Oh, Robert took all the options that saved more than 1 life per \\$500,000 and rejected all options that saved less than 1 life per \\$500,000; so Robert's behavior is *consistent* with his spending \\$500,000 per life.\"\n\nAlternatively, if we can't view Robert's behavior as being coherent in this sense--if we cannot make up *any* dollar value of a human life, such that Robert's choices are consistent with that dollar value--then it must be possible to move around the same amount of money in a way that saves more lives.\n\nSo if we start from the qualitative criterion, \"Robert must save as many lives as possible; it shouldn't be possible to move around the same money to save more lives\", we end up with the quantitative coherence theorem, \"It must be possible to view Robert as trading dollars for lives at some consistent price.\"\n\nAnd then the caveats and subtleties:\n\nWe haven't proven that dollars have some intrinsic worth that trades off against the intrinsic worth of a human life.  By hypothesis, Robert doesn't care about money at all.  It's just that every dollar has an *opportunity cost* in lives it could have saved if deployed differently; and this opportunity cost is the same for every dollar because money is fungible; and that implies a consistent trading rate between dollars and lives.\n\nWe haven't proven that there's some specific dollar value in Robert's head; we've only proven that Robert's behavior can be *viewed as if* it prices lives at *some* consistent value.  It could be the case, for example, that Robert accepts every option that spends less than \\$500,000/life and rejects every option that spends over \\$600,000 and there aren't any available options in the middle.  Then Robert's behavior can equally be viewed as consistent with a price of \\$510,000 or a price of \\$590,000.  Maybe Robert himself never lets himself think a specific threshold value, because it would be Wrong to assign a dollar value to human life, and instead Robert just fiddles the money until he can't save any more lives.  Coherence theorems aren't about psychology--they aren't about how agents think or compute their actions--they're about the actions themselves.\n\nWe have not proved ab initio by pure logic that Robert must want, in the first place, to save as many lives as possible.  Maybe Robert values a 10-year-old's life at 5 times the value of a 70-year-old's life, so that Robert will sacrifice five grandparents to save one 10-year-old.\n\nHm!  Let's consider that last possibility more thoroughly.  If Robert considers a preteen equally valuable with 5 grandparents, so that Robert will shift \\$100,000 from saving 8 old people to saving 2 children, then Robert *shouldn't* be saving as many lives as possible.  That last decision would decrease by 6 the total number of lives saved.  So we can no longer say that there's a qualitative criterion, 'Save as many lives as possible', that produces the quantitative coherence requirement, 'trade dollars for lives at a consistent rate'.\n\nDoes this mean that Robert's behavior might as well go out the window, so far as coherence is concerned?  Anything goes, now?  Just spend money wherever?\n\n\"Hm,\" you might think again.  \"But... if Robert trades 8 old people for 2 children *here*... and then trades 1 child for 2 old people *here*...\"\n\nBut now this is getting needlessly disturbing, so let's make it about apples and oranges instead.\n\n- Alice starts with 8 apples and 1 orange.\n- Then Alice trades 8 apples for 2 oranges.\n- Then Alice trades away 1 orange for 2 apples.\n- Finally, Alice trades another orange for 3 apples.\n\nThen Alice is using a strategy that's strictly dominated across categories of fruit.  She ends up with 5 apples and one orange, but could've had 8 apples and one orange by just not making any trades.  Regardless of the *relative* value of apples and oranges, the strategy is still doing strictly worse than another strategy, if the fruit have any positive value at all.\n\nSo the fact that Alice can't be seen as having any coherent relative value for apples and oranges, corresponds to her ending up with qualitatively less fruit across all categories.\n\nSimilarly--shifting our attention back to Robert for a moment--*either* we can view Robert as consistently assigning some relative value of life for 10-year-olds vs. 70-year-olds, *or* there must be a way to rearrange Robert's expenditures to save strictly more 10-year-olds or strictly more 70-year-olds.\n\nThen since this relative value is consistent, we can indeed go around saying, \"Robert is behaving as if one 10-year-old is worth five 70-year-olds\", and if we *can't* say anything like this, then there's some way to move around Robert's money and save more people across every category.\n\nAnd since the same logic applies to 50-year-olds, we must be able to say, \"Well, Robert is behaving as if a 50-year-old is worth 0.3 10-year-olds and a 70-year-old is worth 0.2 10-year-olds\", or something like that, on pain of Robert behaving in a way that qualitatively discards some lives he could have saved. \n\nOr perhaps Robert is just behaving in a way which implies that some 10-year-olds are worth more than others... but then *those* relative values need to be viewable as quantitatively coherent, or again, Robert must be qualitatively discarding some of what he said he would protect.\n\nGeneralizing this idea further:  If we can consistently view any agent as ending up with as much as is qualitatively possible of *anything*, whatever that agent says it values, however the agent says it says it values some things more than others... the agent must be behaving in a way consistent with it assigning all the things *coherent relative values.*\n\nAnd since you can denominate apples in oranges, and price oranges in pears, and trade off pears for apples at consistent rates, you might as well factor out a completely abstract unit for ease of notation.\n\nLet's call this unit... *1 utilon,* and denote it &euro;1.\n\nIf we say that apples are worth &euro;0.5, oranges are worth &euro;1.0, and pears are worth &euro;1.3, then this tells us the relative value of apples, oranges, and pears.  Conversely, if we *can* assign consistent relative values to apples, oranges, and pears, then we can factor out an arbitrary abstract unit at will--for example, by arbitrarily declaring apples to be worth &euro;10 and then pricing everything else in apples.\n\nHave we proven by pure logic that all apples have the same utility?  Of course not; you can prefer some particular apples to other particular apples and then they needn't have the same utility.  But when you're done saying which things you qualitatively prefer to which other things, if you go around making tradeoffs in way that can be *viewed as* not qualitatively leaving behind some things you said you wanted, we can *view you* as assigning coherent quantitative utilities to everything you want.\n\nAnd that's one coherence theorem--among others--that can be seen as motivating the concept of *utility* in decision theory.\n\nUtility isn't a solid thing, a separate thing.  We could multiply all the utilities by two, and that would correspond to all the same outward behaviors.  It's meaningless to ask how much utility you got at the end of your life, because we could subtract a million or add a million to that quantity while leaving all everything conceptually the same.\n\nIndeed, you could pick anything you valued--say, the joy of watching a cat chase a laser pointer for 10 seconds--and denominate everything relative to that, without needing any concept of a separate extra utility.  So just to be clear and to avoid any possible confusion, this philosophy does not say that there is a separate thing 'utility' which you should be pursuing *instead of* everything else you wanted in life.\n\nAnd of course this coherence theorem says nothing about which things to value or how much to value them relative to other things, any more than the notion of a coherently transitive preference ordering $>_P$ tells us whether onions $>_P$ pineapple.\n\n(And if you had the notion that 'utility' had something to do with assigning equal value to all human lives, or equal value to all sentient lives, or equal value to all Quality-Adjusted Life Years... then, our apologies, but that's *utilitarianism* which is ]a whole 'nother separate philosophy.  Sorry!)\n\nThe conceptual thingy that maps thingies or outcomes to utilities--the conceptual object that takes in a thingy and spits out a utility--is a 'utility function'.  Again, this isn't something that's written in stone somewhere, or even explicitly written inside your mind.  If we multiply the utility function by 9.2, that's conceptually the same utility function because it's still consistent with the same set of behaviors.\n\n# Probabilities and expected utility\n\nWe've so far made no mention of *probability.*  But the way that probabilities and utilities interact, is where we start to see the full structure that all the coherence theorems point to; and it is where we get the idea of 'expected utility' in the formal sense of a probabilistic expectation.\n\n(Work in progress.
