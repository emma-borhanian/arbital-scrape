      "text": "*(Somewhere in physical reality or the Internet, in a not-very-near neighboring world...)*\n\nBeta:  Hello, Alpha.  We've noticed that talk has become a great deal more common of late, about various speculations of \"space-planes\" being used to attack cities, or possibly becoming infused with malevolent spirits that inhabit the celestial realms so that they turn on their own engineers.  We're rather skeptical of these speculations, and indeed, we're a bit skeptical that airplanes will be able to rise higher than the atmosphere at all.  But we understand that your institute wants to address the potential problem of evil space-planes, and that you think this is an important present-day cause.\n\nAlpha:  That's... really not how we at the Mathematics of Intentional Rocketry Institute would phrase things.  Yes, the problem of malevolent celestial spirits is what all the news articles are focusing on, but we think the real problem is something entirely different.  We're worried that there's a hard, theoretically confusing problem which modern-day rocket punditry is mostly overlooking, the part where the rocket actually arrives at the destination you have in mind.  Roughly, we're worried that even if you aim a rocket at the Moon, so that the nose of the rocket is very clearly lined up with the Moon in the sky, the rocket won't go to the Moon.\n\nBeta:  Why?\n\nAlpha:  Well, that's not easy to explain.  Part of the problem is that realistic calculations are extremely hard to do in this area, after you take into account all the atmospheric friction and the gravitational pulls of the other celestial bodies and so on.  But we've been trying to figure out some admittedly unrealistic example problems in this area, on the order of assuming that all rockets move in straight lines; and even those very unrealistic calculations strongly suggest on an intuitive level that in the much more complicated real world, just pointing your rocket's nose at the Moon won't make your rocket end up at the Moon.  Right now, *nobody* can tell you which direction you should point the rocket's nose so that it goes to the Moon.  Whether Google or the US Government or North Korea is the one to launch the rocket won't make a pragmatic difference to the outcome from our perspective, because *nobody knows how to point any kind of rocket at all*.  What we want to do is try to push on our understanding of rocket trajectories until we have a better, deeper understanding of what we've started calling the rocket alignment problem.\n\nBeta:  I've looked at your explanations of some of the math you're trying to do, and I can't say I understand what it has to do with the Moon.  Shouldn't helping spaceplane pilots exactly target the Moon involve looking through lunar telescopes and studying exactly what the Moon looks like, so that the spaceplane pilots can identify particular features of the landscape to land on?\n\nAlpha:  We think our present stage of understanding is much too crude for that to be our next research target.  It's more along the lines of \"figure out how to talk mathematically about curved rocket trajectories, instead of rockets that move in straight lines\".  Not even realistically curved trajectories, right now, we're just trying to get past straight lines at all -\n\nBeta:  But planes on Earth move in curved lines all the time, because the Earth itself is curved.  It seems reasonable to expect that future spaceplanes will also have the capability to move in curved lines.  If your worry is that spaceplanes will only move in straight lines and miss the Moon, and you want to advise rocket engineers to build rockets that move in curved lines, well, that just doesn't seem to me like a great use of charitable dollars.\n\nAlpha:  You're still trying to draw much too direct of a line between the math we're working on right now, and actual rocket designs that might actually exist in the future.  The conceptual distance that separates anyone from solving the rocket alignment problem is much greater than that.  We're trying to become *less confused* about rocket trajectories.  Our next job is to improve our understanding, not to run right out and advise rocket engineers to build their rockets the way that our current math papers are talking about.  It's not going to be as simple as running over and yelling \"Hey, make the rockets move in curved trajectories!\"  Not until we stop being so *confused* about very basic questions like why the Earth doesn't just fall down into the Sun's gravity well.\n\nBeta:  I don't think the Earth is going to collide with the Sun anytime soon.  The Sun has been steadily circling the Earth for a long time now.\n\nAlpha:  We're not saying that our goal is to address the risk of the Earth falling into the Sun.  What I'm trying to convey is that if we can't answer questions like \"Why doesn't the Earth fall into the Sun?\" then we don't know very much about celestial mechanics and we won't be able to aim a rocket to move through celestial spaces in a way that hits the Moon.  As an example of work we're presently doing that's aimed at improving our understanding, there's what we call the \"tiling positions\" problem.  The tiling positions problem is how to fire a cannonball from a cannon in such a way that the cannonball returns to its exact initial position an infinite number of times, \"tiling\" the sequence of coordinates like repeating tiles on a tesselated floor -\n\nBeta:  Yes, it's very hard for me to see what firing things from cannons has to do with getting to the Moon.  In fact, it seems extremely old-fashioned.  Jules Verne thought it was possible to get into space by firing things out of cannons, but the modern study of high-altitude planes has completely abandoned the notion of firing things out of cannons.  The fact that you go around talking about firing things out of cannons suggests to me that you haven't kept up with all the innovations in airplane design over the last century, and that your spaceplane designs will be completely unrealistic.\n\nAlpha:  We know that rockets will not actually be fired out of cannons.  We really, really know that.  We are intimately familiar with the reasons why nothing fired out of a modern cannon is ever going to reach escape velocity, and can describe them at great length, and have indeed done so in several lengthy articles in which we describe how of course rockets aren't fired from cannons so there's no point in making such a big deal out of \"non-cannon\" rocketry that uses those giant rubber bands.\n\nBeta:  But your current paper is all about firing something out a cannon in such a way that it returns to its exact initial position.  What could that possibly have to do with any realistic advice that you could give to a spaceplane designer?\n\nAlpha:  Again, you're trying to draw far too direct a line between the math we're doing right now, and immediate advice for future rocket designs.  What we think is that if we could only find an angle and firing speed such that an ideal cannon, firing an ideal cannonball at that speed, on a perfectly spherical Earth with no atmosphere, would lead to that cannonball returning to the starting point, we might understand something really fundamental and important about celestial mechanics.  Or maybe not!  It's hard to know in advance which problems are important.  All you can do is figure out the next crisply stated problem that confuses you, and try to come up with a crisp solution, and hope that you'll be less confused after that.\n\nBeta:  You talk about the cannonball hitting the ground as a problem, and how you want to avoid that and just have the cannonball keep going forever, right?  But real spaceplanes aren't going to be aimed at the ground in the first place, and lots of regular airplanes manage to not hit the ground.  It seems to me that this \"being fired out of a cannon into the ground\" scenario that you're trying to avoid in this \"tiling positions problem\" of yours just isn't something that real spaceplane designers would need to worry about.\n\nAlpha:  *We are not worried* about real rockets being fired out of cannons into the ground.  That is not why we're working on the tiling positions problem.  We're working on the tiling positions problem because we think that being able to fire a cannonball at a certain instantaneous velocity such that it returns to its starting point, is the sort of problem that somebody who could *really actually launch a rocket through space and have it move in a particular curve that actually ended with landing on the Moon* would be able to do *very easily*.  So the fact that we *can't* do it is alarming, if we can figure out how to solve the much simpler, much more crisply stated \"tiling positions problem\" that's a lot easier to analyze mathematically than a complete Moon launch, we'll have taken another step towards being the sort of people who could actually plot out a Moon launch *not* using cannons.\n\nBeta:  If you don't think that Jules-Verne-style space cannons are the wave of the future, I don't understand why you keep talking about them.\n\nAlpha:  Because there's a lot of sophisticated mathematical machinery already developed for aiming cannons.  People have been aiming cannons and plotting cannonball trajectories since the sixteenth century.  We can take advantage of that existing mathematics to say exactly how, if we fired an ideal cannonball in a certain direction, it would plow into the ground.  If we tried talking about rockets with realistically varying acceleration, we can't even manage to prove that a rocket like that *won't* travel around the Earth in a perfect square because with all that realistically varying acceleration and realistic air friction it's impossible to make any sort of definite statement one way or another.  Our present mathematics isn't up to it.\n\nBeta:  I don't think I believe that any future rocket design will be the sort of thing that can be analyzed with absolute, perfect precision so that you can get the rocket to the Moon based on an absolutely plotted trajectory with no need to steer.  That seems to me like a bunch of mathematicians who have no clue how things work in the real world, wanting everything to be absolutely calculated and perfect.\n\nAlpha:  It's true that it's futile to try to predict, in advance, the exact trajectories of all of the winds that will strike a rocket on its way off the ground.  Though I'll mention parenthetically that things might actually become calmer and easier to predict, once a rocket gets *sufficiently* high up -\n\nBeta:  Why?\n\nAlpha:  Let's just leave that aside for now, since we both agree that rocket positions are hard to predict exactly during the sub-orbital part of the trajectory due to winds and so on.  The *point* of doing rocket math isn't that you want to know the rocket's exact position at every microsecond, in advance.\n\nBeta:  Then what's the point?  Why do math that doesn't describe the universe?\n\nAlpha:  Look, I *know* that a real rocket isn't a simple equation on a board!  I know there are all sorts of aspects of a real rocket's shape and internal plumbing that aren't going to have a mathematically compact characterization.  What MIRI is doing isn't the right degree of mathematization for all rocket engineers for all time, it's the right degree of mathematics for *us* to be using *right now* - or so we hope.  To build up the field's understanding incrementally, we need to talk about ideas whose consequences can be pinpointed precisely enough that people can analyze scenarios in a shared framework.  We need enough precision that someone can say, \"I think in scenario X, rocket design Y does Z\", and someone else can say, \"No, it actually does not-Z\", and the first person is like \"Darn, you're right.  Well, is there some way to repair it and make it Z?\"  If you try to make things *realistically complicated* at this stage of research, all you're left with is verbal fantasies.  It's like how, when you talk to one of the people who have this enormous flowchart of all the machinery and steering rudders they think should go into a rocket design, and you try to explain why a rocket pointed at the Moon doesn't necessarily end up at the Moon, they just reply \"Oh, my rocket won't do *that*.\"  Their ideas have enough vagueness and flex and underspecification that they've achieved the safety of being impossible to falsify.  It's impossible to incrementally build up a body of collective knowledge that way.  It's impossible to start building up a mental toolbox of ideas whose consequences you understand, individually or collectively.  We try to find ways to represent the key ideas in mathematically crisp ways, so that we can have arguments about them that go beyond \"Does not!\" vs. \"Does so!\"  I mean, things get *really really bad* when people don't do that.\n\nBeta:  I feel like you're reaching for the warm, comforting blanket of mathematical reassurance in a realm where mathematical reassurance doesn't apply.  \n\nBeta:  I just find it hard to imagine that this is how real rocket science will get done.  \n\nwe can obtain a mathematical proof of the rocket reaching the Moon.  Obviously, you can't obtain a mathematical assurance of any physical proposition. \n\nWe can't obtain a mathematical certainty of our spaceplanes being absolutely sure to reach the Moon with nothing going wrong, because we might always be blown off course by a space hurricane.  Since we can't obtain the absolute certainty you long for, there's no point in trying to pretend that we can do math about spaceplanes.\n\n  And believe me, it's frustrating when you try to talk to one of the people who thinks that rockets will just be pulled into the Moon by the Moon's natural gravity, and they want you to prove to them that their plan won't work, and every time you try to explain what might go wrong, they just reply \"Oh, I won't steer in *that* direction.\"\n\n  To build up your understanding incrementally, you need to talk about things whose behavior you can pinpoint well enough that people can analyze scenarios in a shared framework and try to agree where a given unrealistic rocket design will go.  If you try to make things \"realistic\" at this stage, you're left with blank stares and verbal fantasies.\n\n\n\nWhat we're trying to do is come up with a very simple case of a new kind trajectory that is, in a certain deep sense, a lot more interesting then just throwing a ball at a post.  \n\nBeta:  It seems to me that a lot of your present mathematical work is extremely unrealistic, and that the present study of airplanes suggests that real spaceplanes will not be anything like this.  They won't have infinite fuel, perfectly pointed noses, or move through a perfect vacuum that makes it impossible to steer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we believe for reasons that it would torture this metaphor to try to describe in rocketry language, if a rocket lands on the Moon, that's extremely good.  But if any rocket is successfully launched at faster than escape velocity and it *doesn't* land on the Moon, that's extremely bad -\n\nBeta:  Yes, it's clear that you have a number of weird assumptions at work, such as this concept of \"escape velocity\".  Why wouldn't spaceplanes eventually slow down and halt in the celestial atmosphere, which could easily be even more resistant than the atmosphere on Earth?  Special Relativity says that no rocket can go infinitely fast, and that seems to argue against them moving at dangerous speeds.\n\nAlpha:  The concept of \"escape velocity\" isn't as non-mainstream as you seem to think; it's been a pretty well-known hypothesis since the days the field of rocketry got started.  But let's leave that aside for a moment; it's probably wiser to tackle one issue at a time, like the way we'd frame the whole problem here at the Mathematical Institute for Rocketry Intentions.\n\nBeta:  Well, fine, but we still think that's an important issue.\n\nAlpha:  I agree!  I just want to talk about one point at a time.  The way we'd phrase the problem is that we're not concerned about the sort of malevolent celestial spirits you read about in the media, which we agree are theoretically silly.  We're worried that most of the current proposals we've read for *steering* the rockets basically just say \"We'll point it at the Moon and fire the engines\", and our own preliminary analysis suggests that this kind of rocket doesn't go anywhere near the Moon, even if the only forces acting on the rocket are its own engines.  Actually, it's a bit worse than this, the proposals that call for aiming the rocket in the general direction of the Moon are the *good* ones, there seem to be an awful lot of rocketeers out there who are solely concerned with rising higher than geosynchronous orbit -\n\nBeta:  ]",

      "text": "*(Somewhere in physical reality or the Internet, in a not-very-near neighboring world...)*\n\nBeta:  Hello, Alpha.  We've noticed that talk has become a great deal more common of late, about various speculations of \"space-planes\" being used to attack cities, or possibly becoming infused with malevolent spirits that inhabit the celestial realms so that they turn on their own engineers.  We're rather skeptical of these speculations, and indeed, we're a bit skeptical that airplanes will be able to rise higher than the atmosphere at all.  But we understand that your institute wants to address the potential problem of evil space-planes, and that you think this is an important present-day cause.\n\nAlpha:  That's... really not how we at the Mathematics of Intentional Rocketry Institute would phrase things.  Yes, the problem of malevolent celestial spirits is what all the news articles are focusing on, but we think the real problem is something entirely different.  We're worried that there's a hard, theoretically confusing problem which modern-day rocket punditry is mostly overlooking, the part where the rocket actually arrives at the destination you have in mind.  Roughly, we're worried that even if you aim a rocket at the Moon, so that the nose of the rocket is very clearly lined up with the Moon in the sky, the rocket won't go to the Moon.\n\nBeta:  Why?\n\nAlpha:  Well, that's not easy to explain.  Part of the problem is that realistic calculations are extremely hard to do in this area, after you take into account all the atmospheric friction and the gravitational pulls of the other celestial bodies and so on.  But we've been trying to figure out some admittedly unrealistic example problems in this area, on the order of assuming that all rockets move in straight lines; and even those very unrealistic calculations strongly suggest on an intuitive level that in the much more complicated real world, just pointing your rocket's nose at the Moon won't make your rocket end up at the Moon.  Right now, *nobody* can tell you which direction you should point the rocket's nose so that it goes to the Moon.  Whether Google or the US Government or North Korea is the one to launch the rocket won't make a pragmatic difference to the outcome from our perspective, because *nobody knows how to point any kind of rocket at all*.  What we want to do is try to push on our understanding of rocket trajectories until we have a better, deeper understanding of what we've started calling the rocket alignment problem.\n\nBeta:  I've looked at your explanations of some of the math you're trying to do, and I can't say I understand what it has to do with the Moon.  Shouldn't helping spaceplane pilots exactly target the Moon involve looking through lunar telescopes and studying exactly what the Moon looks like, so that the spaceplane pilots can identify particular features of the landscape to land on?\n\nAlpha:  We think our present stage of understanding is much too crude for that to be our next research target.  It's more along the lines of \"figure out how to talk mathematically about curved rocket trajectories, instead of rockets that move in straight lines\".  Not even realistically curved trajectories, right now, we're just trying to get past straight lines at all -\n\nBeta:  But planes on Earth move in curved lines all the time, because the Earth itself is curved.  It seems reasonable to expect that future spaceplanes will also have the capability to move in curved lines.  If your worry is that spaceplanes will only move in straight lines and miss the Moon, and you want to advise rocket engineers to build rockets that move in curved lines, well, that just doesn't seem to me like a great use of charitable dollars.\n\nAlpha:  You're still trying to draw much too direct of a line between the math we're working on right now, and actual rocket designs that might actually exist in the future.  The conceptual distance that separates anyone from solving the rocket alignment problem is much greater than that.  We're trying to become *less confused* about rocket trajectories.  Our next job is to improve our understanding, not to run right out and advise rocket engineers to build their rockets the way that our current math papers are talking about.  It's not going to be as simple as running over and yelling \"Hey, make the rockets move in curved trajectories!\"  Not until we stop being so *confused* about very basic questions like why the Earth doesn't just fall down into the Sun's gravity well.\n\nBeta:  I don't think the Earth is going to collide with the Sun anytime soon.  The Sun has been steadily circling the Earth for a long time now.\n\nAlpha:  We're not saying that our goal is to address the risk of the Earth falling into the Sun.  What I'm trying to convey is that if we can't answer questions like \"Why doesn't the Earth fall into the Sun?\" then we don't know very much about celestial mechanics and we won't be able to aim a rocket to move through celestial spaces in a way that hits the Moon.  As an example of work we're presently doing that's aimed at improving our understanding, there's what we call the \"tiling positions\" problem.  The tiling positions problem is how to fire a cannonball from a cannon in such a way that the cannonball returns to its exact initial position an infinite number of times, \"tiling\" the sequence of coordinates like repeating tiles on a tesselated floor -\n\nBeta:  Yes, it's very hard for me to see what firing things from cannons has to do with getting to the Moon.  In fact, it seems extremely old-fashioned.  Jules Verne thought it was possible to get into space by firing things out of cannons, but the modern study of high-altitude planes has completely abandoned the notion of firing things out of cannons.  The fact that you go around talking about firing things out of cannons suggests to me that you haven't kept up with all the innovations in airplane design over the last century, and that your spaceplane designs will be completely unrealistic.\n\nAlpha:  We know that rockets will not actually be fired out of cannons.  We really, really know that.  We are intimately familiar with the reasons why nothing fired out of a modern cannon is ever going to reach escape velocity, and can describe them at great length, and have indeed done so in several lengthy articles in which we describe how of course rockets aren't fired from cannons so there's no point in making such a big deal out of \"non-cannon\" rocketry that uses those giant rubber bands.\n\nBeta:  But your current paper is all about firing something out a cannon in such a way that it returns to its exact initial position.  What could that possibly have to do with any realistic advice that you could give to a spaceplane designer?\n\nAlpha:  Again, you're trying to draw far too direct a line between the math we're doing right now, and immediate advice for future rocket designs.  What we think is that if we could only find an angle and firing speed such that an ideal cannon, firing an ideal cannonball at that speed, on a perfectly spherical Earth with no atmosphere, would lead to that cannonball returning to the starting point, we might understand something really fundamental and important about celestial mechanics.  Or maybe not!  It's hard to know in advance which problems are important.  All you can do is figure out the next crisply stated problem that confuses you, and try to come up with a crisp solution, and hope that you'll be less confused after that.\n\nBeta:  You talk about the cannonball hitting the ground as a problem, and how you want to avoid that and just have the cannonball keep going forever, right?  But real spaceplanes aren't going to be aimed at the ground in the first place, and lots of regular airplanes manage to not hit the ground.  It seems to me that this \"being fired out of a cannon into the ground\" scenario that you're trying to avoid in this \"tiling positions problem\" of yours just isn't something that real spaceplane designers would need to worry about.\n\nAlpha:  *We are not worried* about real rockets being fired out of cannons into the ground.  That is not why we're working on the tiling positions problem.  We're working on the tiling positions problem because we think that being able to fire a cannonball at a certain instantaneous velocity such that it returns to its starting point, is the sort of problem that somebody who could *really actually launch a rocket through space and have it move in a particular curve that actually ended with landing on the Moon* would be able to do *very easily*.  So the fact that we *can't* do it is alarming, if we can figure out how to solve the much simpler, much more crisply stated \"tiling positions problem\" that's a lot easier to analyze mathematically than a complete Moon launch, we'll have taken another step towards being the sort of people who could actually plot out a Moon launch *not* using cannons.\n\nBeta:  If you don't think that Jules-Verne-style space cannons are the wave of the future, I don't understand why you keep talking about them.\n\nAlpha:  Because there's a lot of sophisticated mathematical machinery already developed for aiming cannons.  People have been aiming cannons and plotting cannonball trajectories since the sixteenth century.  We can take advantage of that existing mathematics to say exactly how, if we fired an ideal cannonball in a certain direction, it would plow into the ground.  If we tried talking about rockets with realistically varying acceleration, we can't even manage to prove that a rocket like that *won't* travel around the Earth in a perfect square because with all that realistically varying acceleration and realistic air friction it's impossible to make any sort of definite statement one way or another.  Our present mathematics isn't up to it.\n\nBeta:  I don't think I believe that any future rocket design will be the sort of thing that can be analyzed with absolute, perfect precision so that you can get the rocket to the Moon based on an absolutely plotted trajectory with no need to steer.  That seems to me like a bunch of mathematicians who have no clue how things work in the real world, wanting everything to be absolutely calculated and perfect.\n\nAlpha:  It's true that it's futile to try to predict, in advance, the exact trajectories of all of the winds that will strike a rocket on its way off the ground.  Though I'll mention parenthetically that things might actually become calmer and easier to predict, once a rocket gets *sufficiently* high up -\n\nBeta:  Why?\n\nAlpha:  Let's just leave that aside for now, since we both agree that rocket positions are hard to predict exactly during the sub-orbital part of the trajectory due to winds and so on.  The *point* of doing rocket math isn't that you want to know the rocket's exact position at every microsecond, in advance.\n\nBeta:  Then what's the point?  Why do math that doesn't describe the universe?\n\nAlpha:  Look, I *know* that a real rocket isn't a simple equation on a board!  I know there are all sorts of aspects of a real rocket's shape and internal plumbing that aren't going to have a mathematically compact characterization.  What MIRI is doing isn't the right degree of mathematization for all rocket engineers for all time, it's the right degree of mathematics for *us* to be using *right now* - or so we hope.  To build up the field's understanding incrementally, we need to talk about ideas whose consequences can be pinpointed precisely enough that people can analyze scenarios in a shared framework.  We need enough precision that someone can say, \"I think in scenario X, rocket design Y does Z\", and someone else can say, \"No, it actually does not-Z\", and the first person is like \"Darn, you're right.  Well, is there some way to repair it and make it Z?\"  If you try to make things *realistically complicated* at this stage of research, all you're left with is verbal fantasies.  It's like how, when you talk to one of the people who have this enormous flowchart of all the machinery and steering rudders they think should go into a rocket design, and you try to explain why a rocket pointed at the Moon doesn't necessarily end up at the Moon, they just reply \"Oh, my rocket won't do *that*.\"  Their ideas have enough vagueness and flex and underspecification that they've achieved the safety of being impossible to falsify.  It's impossible to incrementally build up a body of collective knowledge that way.  It's impossible to start building up a mental toolbox of ideas whose consequences you understand, individually or collectively.  We try to find ways to represent the key ideas in mathematically crisp ways, so that we can have arguments about them that go beyond \"Does not!\" vs. \"Does so!\"  I mean, things get *really really bad* when people don't do that.\n\nBeta:  I feel like you're reaching for the warm, comforting blanket of mathematical reassurance in a realm where mathematical reassurance doesn't apply.  \n\nBeta:  I just find it hard to imagine that this is how real rocket science will get done.  \n\nwe can obtain a mathematical proof of the rocket reaching the Moon.  Obviously, you can't obtain a mathematical assurance of any physical proposition. \n\nWe can't obtain a mathematical certainty of our spaceplanes being absolutely sure to reach the Moon with nothing going wrong, because we might always be blown off course by a space hurricane.  Since we can't obtain the absolute certainty you long for, there's no point in trying to pretend that we can do math about spaceplanes.\n\n  And believe me, it's frustrating when you try to talk to one of the people who thinks that rockets will just be pulled into the Moon by the Moon's natural gravity, and they want you to prove to them that their plan won't work, and every time you try to explain what might go wrong, they just reply \"Oh, I won't steer in *that* direction.\"\n\n  To build up your understanding incrementally, you need to talk about things whose behavior you can pinpoint well enough that people can analyze scenarios in a shared framework and try to agree where a given unrealistic rocket design will go.  If you try to make things \"realistic\" at this stage, you're left with blank stares and verbal fantasies.\n\n\n\nWhat we're trying to do is come up with a very simple case of a new kind trajectory that is, in a certain deep sense, a lot more interesting then just throwing a ball at a post.  \n\nBeta:  It seems to me that a lot of your present mathematical work is extremely unrealistic, and that the present study of airplanes suggests that real spaceplanes will not be anything like this.  They won't have infinite fuel, perfectly pointed noses, or move through a perfect vacuum that makes it impossible to steer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we believe for reasons that it would torture this metaphor to try to describe in rocketry language, if a rocket lands on the Moon, that's extremely good.  But if any rocket is successfully launched at faster than escape velocity and it *doesn't* land on the Moon, that's extremely bad -\n\nBeta:  Yes, it's clear that you have a number of weird assumptions at work, such as this concept of \"escape velocity\".  Why wouldn't spaceplanes eventually slow down and halt in the celestial atmosphere, which could easily be even more resistant than the atmosphere on Earth?  Special Relativity says that no rocket can go infinitely fast, and that seems to argue against them moving at dangerous speeds.\n\nAlpha:  The concept of \"escape velocity\" isn't as non-mainstream as you seem to think; it's been a pretty well-known hypothesis since the days the field of rocketry got started.  But let's leave that aside for a moment; it's probably wiser to tackle one issue at a time, like the way we'd frame the whole problem here at the Mathematical Institute for Rocketry Intentions.\n\nBeta:  Well, fine, but we still think that's an important issue.\n\nAlpha:  I agree!  I just want to talk about one point at a time.  The way we'd phrase the problem is that we're not concerned about the sort of malevolent celestial spirits you read about in the media, which we agree are theoretically silly.  We're worried that most of the current proposals we've read for *steering* the rockets basically just say \"We'll point it at the Moon and fire the engines\", and our own preliminary analysis suggests that this kind of rocket doesn't go anywhere near the Moon, even if the only forces acting on the rocket are its own engines.  Actually, it's a bit worse than this, the proposals that call for aiming the rocket in the general direction of the Moon are the *good* ones, there seem to be an awful lot of rocketeers out there who are solely concerned with rising higher than geosynchronous orbit -\n\nBeta:  ]",
