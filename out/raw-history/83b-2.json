      "text": "This is a FAQ aimed at a very rapid introduction to key standard economic concepts to professionals in AI and machine learning who have become concerned with the potential economic impacts of their work, or who want to participate in conversations about the economic impact of present and future Artificial Intelligence.\n\nYou will in fact need a strong intuitive understanding of \"comparative advantage\", and several other key concepts, to talk sensibly about a declining labor force participation rate and what ought to be done about it.  Just like you yourself might perhaps feel a bit frustrated when trying to discuss which professions are liable to be automated in the near future, with somebody who doesn't understand the notion of gradient descent and why some human jobs have loss functions that are harder to measure and differentiate.  It's not that the concepts are mathematically hard in an absolute sense, it's that you really do need to be parsing the world using those basic concepts.  I won't belabor this point any further.\n\nWithout further ado, here's a quick list of some concepts that this particular author thinks are important:\n\n- **Comparative advantage** says that even if Alice is less efficient (less productive) at all of her tasks than is Bob, Alice and Bob still both benefit from being able to trade with one another.\n - If Alice is *relatively* twice as good at growing apples than she is at growing oranges, and Bob is relatively twice as good at growing oranges than growing apples, Alice and Bob can both benefit by trading her apples for his oranges, even if Bob can grow 10 times as many apples per unit of labor than Alice.\n- The **lump of labour fallacy** is the standard term for the (appealing but incorrect) reasoning which says that if you automate away 95% of the jobs, only 5% of the people remain employed.\n - Humanity did in fact automate away 95% of all labor during the industrial revolution - 98% of the population used to be farmers, and now it's 3% - and yet more than 5% of the people still have jobs.\n - The standard explanation for why we aren't all already unemployed revolves around **complementary inputs:** if it previously took 20 units of labor to make 10 hot dogs and 10 units of labor to make 10 hot dog buns, and then hot-dog-making productivity doubles, the classically predicted new equilibrium is 15 hot dogs and 15 hot dog buns.\n - Maybe this is, in fact, not what is happening right now.  But it's definitely what happened during most of human history, and you need to intuitively understand the background classical prediction in order to *not* just try to reinterpret the present situation through the eyes of the lump of labour fallacy.\n- The *broken window fallacy** is the standard term for the (appealing but incorrect) reasoning which says that if you heave a rock through somebody's window, they have to pay the glazier to repair the window, and the glazier buys bread from the baker, and so production thrives and everybody is better off.\n - The key to understanding *why* this is a fallacy will revolve around the concept of **aggregate demand**.  Under normal conditions the economy should be bounded by the available supply of glass and similar goods, and destroying goods in one place diverts them from somewhere else.  Modern economies *can* get into wedged states where glaziers are sitting idle; and the economy is then bounded by a different quantity, the amount of flowing money available to animate trades.  But heaving a rock through a window doesn't increase this quantity either.\n- When a good has a relatively low-sloped **supply curve** (curve for supply versus price), subsidizing that good will tend to increase its price much more than the amount of that good.\n - If you make it easier for people to take out loans to go to universities, but it's not very easy to build lots of new universities, the result is that people end up with a lot of student loan debt.\n- \"Inequality\" in a bad sense usually results from **rent extraction.**  Under some conditions, equilibrium extractible rents sometimes only go up when people's incomes would otherwise rise.\n - Reading articles written by actual poor people in the US gives the strong impression that one's top priority for helping them ought to be outlawing towing fees.\n - This is one potential thing that might go wrong with the basic income.  It might possibly just cause the Ferguson Police Department to issue more tickets, unless you fix the Ferguson Police Department first.\n - Excessive intellectual property protection can also cause excess concentration of rents.\n - Economies of scale in dealing with regulators -- being able to afford lawyers -- can effectively protect big companies from competition and enable them to extract monopoly rents.\n- **Labor market flexibility** (aka the ability of people to move around and match up with available jobs) is a critical factor in employment.  This can be hindered by e.g. restrictions on building more housing in cities with high labor demand.\n - We could equally view this as due to major employers continuing to situate new jobs in the cities with already-skyrocketing housing prices.  (One observes that, often, these housing costs are relatively far less burdensome on the high-level decision makers who decide where to put the company.)\n- **Effective marginal tax rates** are how much benefit accrues to somebody who earns 1 more dollar at their current wage level.  Not just due to income taxes and payroll taxes, but also due to phasing-out of benefits, it's possible for somebody who earns +$1 to be effectively +$0.20 better off, or even for this number to go negative.\n - Current estimates of effective marginal tax rates in low income brackets are usually in the range of 70% and on many 'cliffs' higher than 100%.\n- Alternatives to minimum wage include **wage subsidies.**\n - We can consider the minimum wage as a subsidy on wages paid for by a marginal tax on employers who hire people at less than the minimum wage.  If society thinks this subsidy is a good idea, it should almost certainly not be paid for by those particular employers.\n- Alternatives to labor taxes include **land value tax** and **consumption taxes.**\n - If you tax labor, you'll discourage labor.  Taxing the implicit rents on land doesn't cause there to be less land, so it's a less distortive tax.\n- **Sticky prices** of labor, especially **downward sticky** wages, cause small amounts of deflation to do far more damage to economies than small amounts of deflation.\n - This is one reason why modern economics suggests trying to stabilize an economy at 2% inflation rather than 0% inflation; small amounts of inflation help prices adjust to new realities over time.\n - There's an up-and-coming view, not yet fully adopted, which rephrases the view as being about the total amount of flowing money, and says that people lose their jobs when there isn't enough flowing money to pay their wages.  This view suggests that the best help monetary policy can give to employment is **targeting a price level** of **per-capita NGDP.**\n\nMany readers will also have common ideas about:\n\n- Regulatory burdens on employers decreasing employment.\n- \"Regulatory capture\" by large corporations influencing regulators to make it harder for new entrants to compete with them.\n- Regulatory compliance costs generally decreasing economic productivity.\n\nThere is not universal agreement on how large these problems are, or whether they should be top priorities.  But standard economics does not regard these ideas as *naive,* so I won't discuss them any further in this FAQ.  My purpose here is to introduce relatively more technical concepts, that are more likely to be new to the reader, and that refute appealing-sounding views that are widely regarded by professional economists as being misguided on technical grounds.\n\nThis document is currently incomplete, and the Table of Contents below shows what is currently covered.\n\n[toc:]\n\n# Comparative advantage, and the mercantilist fallacy\n\nRicardo's Law of Comparative Advantage says that parties (individuals, groups, countries) can both benefit from trading with each other, even when one party is *strictly more productive* than the other.\n\n- Suppose Alice can produce 20 apples per unit of labor, and 10 oranges per unit of labor.\n- Bob can produce 50 apples per unit of labor, and 100 oranges per unit of labor.\n- Alice and Bob both have 10 units of labor to use.\n\nIf Alice wants an equal number of apples and oranges, she's better off producing 200 apples with all of her labor, and then trading 100 of the apples to Bob for 100 oranges.\n\nBob in turn is better off producing 100 oranges with 1 unit of labor, and trading them to Alice for 100 apples, than Bob would be if he used 2 units of labor to produce 100 apples directly.\n\nEconomists usually regard this idea as refuting some intuitive ideas about *mercantilism,* which says that countries are better off the more they sell, and worse off the more they buy.\n\nAnother possibly-not-intuitive consequence of comparative advantage is that, except for *sticky prices* (see below), the exchange rates on a country's currency have little long-run effect on its trade.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- Germany buys 100,000 dollars from the US for 100,000 euros;\n- Germany then uses these 100,000 dollars to buy 100 air conditioners from the US;\n- People in the US use their 100,000 euros to buy 10 cars from Germany.\n\nSuppose the European Central Bank then prints twice as many euros and credibly commits to never buy them back, cutting the value of its currency in half.  Then:\n\n- People in Germany buy 100,000 dollars from people in the US, using 200,000 euros.\n- People in Germany buy 100 air conditioners from the US.\n- People in the US buy 10 cars from Germany, each of which now costs twice as much, for a total of 200,000 euros.\n\nRoughly, Ricardo's Law suggests that we view the US as shipping 100 air conditioners to Germany in exchange for 10 cars, with the monetary exchange rates being something of an epiphenomenon.  In practice this is modified by \"sticky prices\" in that some people already own euros or dollars, or bonds denominated in euros or dollars, and there are existing sales contracts that fix prices for a term.  But most models have effects like this washing out over the long run.\n\nThe concept of comparative advantage is important for discussing technological unemployment because it conveys the general idea that when we draw a line around a group or region, like \"Alice\" or \"Wisconsin\", this region is not harmed by being able to trade with someone else who is much more productive than them (never mind getting their own advanced technology).\n\nThis isn't to say that technological advances can't ever hurt Wisconsin's economy.  Maybe Wisconsin is trading cheese to Ohio in exchange for coal.  One day, Michigan becomes much more efficient than Wisconsin at producing cheese, causing Ohio to start trading with Michigan instead.  This can hurt Wisconsin's economy, quite a lot.  The conclusion from Ricardo's Law is rather that Wisconsin can't be harmed by the fact of Wisconsin *itself* being allowed to trade with Michigan.  What hurts Wisconsin in this scenario is that *Ohio* is allowed to trade with Michigan.  Wisconsin can only make itself even worse off by hindering its own trade with Michigan.\n\nIf Wisconsin closes its borders and tries to get along in its own little world that doesn't include those awful new cheese-making machines, Ricardo's Law says that Wisconsin as a whole *should* become worse-off thereby.  If this stops being true, then some unusual phenomenon must be at work, one that violates the broad axioms under which Ricardo's Law is a theorem.\n\n(An intuition I'll be trying to promote over this FAQ is that the state of affairs over most of human history, in which technological automation made most people better off without causing them to be permanently unemployed, is a very normal state of affairs from the standpoint of economic theory.  If we're currently looking at lasting unemployment caused by automation, this is a *surprising* state of affairs.  And the reason for it won't be that Ricardo's Law suddenly stopped being a theorem, but rather that something relatively new is going on that wasn't happening during the Industrial Revolution.  And whatever the truth turns out to be, Ricardo's Law will still be a relatively better lens than mercantilism through which to understand it.)\n\n# Complementary inputs, and the lump of labour fallacy\n\nSuppose that:\n\n- People like to eat sausages in buns.\n- Each sausage-in-a-bun requires 1 sausage and 1 bun as an input, and a trivial amount of labor to assemble.\n- At present, it requires 1 unit of labor to make a bun, and 2 units of labor to make a sausage.\n- The resulting equilibrium involves 10 sausages-in-a-bun being manufactured by 30 people expending 30 units of labor.\n\nBroadly speaking, the \"lump of labour\" fallacy says that there's a limited amount of work to be done in the world, and a limited number of jobs to go around, and every time one of those jobs is automated away, one more person ends up unemployed.\n\nSo the question then becomes: if we invent a new kind of sausage-making machine that doubles productivity and makes it possible to produce 2 sausages using 2 units of labor, do we...\n\n- End up with 10-sausages-in-a-bun produced by 20 people, and 10 unemployed former sausage makers?\n- End up with 15-sausages-in-a-bun produced by 30 people?\n\nEnding up in the second equilibrium, maybe not right away, is widely regarded as the core idea behind how we could start with a world where 98% of the population were farmers, improving agricultural productivity by a factor of 100 between then and now, and end up with a world in which 3% of the people are farmers and the other 95% of the population are *not* unemployed.\n\nOne way of looking at this is that, over the course of human history so far, *everything* has behaved like it is complementary.  When agricultural productivity skyrocketed, a bunch of people went into making shoes and clothes and tables and houses, and the end result was that more people had food, more people had more nice clothes and furniture, and not everyone in the world was unemployed.  The \"food\" input to a human became cheaper, and labor went into making more of the \"clothes\" and \"furniture\" inputs to humans.  When manufacturing productivity skyrocketed, people went into services.\n\nNow it could be that this phenomenon is now breaking down for any number of possible reasons.  It seems relatively *implausible* that we have reached *the end of demand* and that all the people now have enough of every kind of good and service that they want.  There are way too many poor and unhappy people still in the world for that to be true!\n\nOkay, so we haven't reached the end of human wants.  But maybe some people in the modern world can no longer produce *anything* that other people want...?\n\nI'd like to encourage you to regard this idea with some surprise, especially the notion that this \"unnecessariat\" exists today, *before* we can reliably build a robot that cleans a dishwasher and puts away the dishes without breaking them.  AI is making progress, but we haven't exactly *finished* conquering par-human perception and motor skills.  Are there really people in the world who can do *nothing* that *anybody* else wants?\n\nHeck, why can't those people trade with *each other*?  If they can at least help each other, and get their own economy going, doesn't Ricardo's Law say that this state of affairs ought to provide a *floor* on their economic activity, and that the group can only benefit further by trading with other groups outside themselves...?\n\nWhy isn't it a theorem that there's never any involuntary employment?  I would encourage you to stare at this result and try to feel surprised by the modern state of the world in which unemployment exists.  It's not that theorems get to overrule reality; but they do say that *more* must be going on than there being a limited lump of human want, a correspondingly limited lump of jobs, and not enough jobs for all the people.\n\nAnother view might suggest that the axioms of classical economics are actually pretty fragile, and it's no surprise if the \"nobody in the world should be unemployed\" theorem fails to hold.  In particular, in a world where there's a minimum cost or minimum danger to hiring someone, people may not be able to produce anything that is worth the minimum cost and danger to their employer.\n\n- If you are a neoliberal, you are likely to think about minimum wages, payroll taxes, occupational licensing, and regulatory burdens.\n- If you are Tyler Cowen, you will worry that some people in the labor pool are actively destructive; that lawsuits have made it harder for employers to use word-of-mouth to blackball destructive people; and that people who have been unemployed for a while, end up in a global pool of people who on *average* have \"zero marginal productivity\", within which employers cannot afford or cannot be bothered to distinguish the positively-productive.\n\nOr if you are of a more leftist persuasion, you may worry that the billionaires are running out of real wants, and that the people who *do* want things are defined by our economy as not having enough money to buy them.\n\nOr if you are a Georgist, you are liable to observe that \"unemployed\" people can't build houses for each other and can't farm food for each other, because the government has decided that they own zero land and aren't allowed to get started anywhere; and to regard this as the real core of the problem.\n\nThere are more than enough possible hypotheses to explain why unemployed people can possibly exist.  But it's also worth noting that there was less lasting unemployment in, say, 1850.  What changed between then and now could be all the regulations saying you can't just go build somebody a house, or it could be increased inequality, or it could be housing prices preventing people from moving to California where there are jobs.  The point is that the problem is *not* that there's only so many jobs in the global lump and AI advances are destroying them.\n\nIt could indeed be that existing AI, and to a much larger degree, ordinary computer programming, have gone a long way towards devaluing many kinds of work that can be done without a high school degree.  And it's definitely possible that, on the margins, AI conquering more perceptual and motor tasks will make *more* people permanently unemployed.\n\nIt's reasonable for people in AI to feel concerned about this, and want to do something to make things better.\n\nBut it's important to be aware that the issue is *not* the end of human want, or the running-out of the lump of labor.  It's important to keep in mind that the issue may not *intrinsically* be that some people have nothing at all to contribute to any remaining human want, but that we've put obstacles in the way of people being allowed to contribute.\n\nAnyway: however you want to look at the situation, and whatever solution you propose, please don't talk about AI or trade or automation \"destroying jobs,\" because it will cause any economists listening you to scream in silent horror that they cannot give voice.\n\n# The broken window fallacy, and aggregate demand\n\n## Surprisingly, recessions turn out to exist\n\nIn theory, when we double the productivity of sausage-makers, we should get 15 sausages-in-buns instead of 10.  We should not get 10 unemployed sausage-makers; or, if we temporarily get 10 unemployed sausage-makers, that state of affairs shouldn't last longer than it takes sausage-makers to become willing to look for work at the booming bun factories with HELP WANTED signs plastered all over their windows.\n\nAnd yet there seem to be these occasions, like the \"Great Depression\" or the \"Great Recession\", when there are silent factories and people standing idle, or the modern equivalent.  The unemployed sausage-makers are willing to look for new jobs, but there aren't tons of HELP WANTED signs to let them get started on retraining.  The bun factories are actually making fewer buns, because now the unemployed sausage-makers aren't buying sausages-in-a-bun anymore.\n\nOne will observe, however, that these historical occasions seem to come on suddenly, and *not* due to sudden brilliant inventions causing a huge jump in productivity.  They happen at around the same time that there's trouble in the financial system--banks blowing up.\n\nFurthermore, the number of idle factories and amount of idle labor seems to be far in excess of what could reasonably be accounted for by sausage-makers needing to change jobs.  And even people with what might seem like very useful skills, can't find anywhere to put them to use.  None of the previous reasons we've considered, for why unemployment could possibly exist, seem to apply to how *that* much unemployment could exist in the Great Depression.  And then a decade later all those people had jobs again, too; so it wasn't something intrinsic to the people or the jobs that caused them to be unemployed for so long.\n\nThat is weird and astonishing!  If your brain doesn't currently think that is weird and astonishing, please try at least briefly to get yourself into the state of mind where it is.\n\n## The broken window fallacy\n\nAs my entry point into explaining this astonishing paradox, I'm going to take an unusual angle and start with the **broken window fallacy.**\n\nThe broken window fallacy was originally pointed out in 1850 by Frederic Bastiat, in a now-famous essay, \"[That Which Is Seen, And That Which Is Not Seen](http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html)\"  Bastiat begins with the parable of a child who has accidentally thrown a rock through somebody's window:\n\n> Have you ever witnessed the anger of the good shopkeeper, James B., when his careless son happened to break a square of glass? If you have been present at such a scene, you will most assuredly bear witness to the fact, that every one of the spectators, were there even thirty of them, by common consent apparently, offered the unfortunate owner this invariable consolation — \"It is an ill wind that blows nobody good. Everybody must live, and what would become of the glaziers if panes of glass were never broken?\"\n\nAnd doesn't the glazier, in turn, spend money at the baker, and the shoemaker, and the baker and shoemaker spend money at the mill and tannery?  Doesn't all of society end up benefiting from this broken window?\n\n> Now, this form of condolence contains an entire theory, which it will be well to show up in this simple case, seeing that it is precisely the same as that which, unhappily, regulates the greater part of our economical institutions.\n\n> Suppose it cost six francs to repair the damage, and you say that the accident brings six francs to the glazier's trade — that it encourages that trade to the amount of six francs — I grant it; I have not a word to say against it; you reason justly. The glazier comes, performs his task, receives his six francs, rubs his hands, and, in his heart, blesses the careless child. All this is that which is seen.\n\n> But if, on the other hand, you come to the conclusion, as is too often the case, that it is a good thing to break windows, that it causes money to circulate, and that the encouragement of industry in general will be the result of it, you will oblige me to call out, \"Stop there! your theory is confined to that which is seen; it takes no account of that which is not seen.\"\n\n> It is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, or added another book to his library. In short, he would have employed his six francs in some way, which this accident has prevented.\n\nAnd this point was widely accepted as persuasive; or at least, it was accepted by economists.\n\nBut actually, Bastiat's original essay is worded in a bit of an odd way.  Why focus on the fact that when the shopkeeper has spent *six francs* in one place, he can't spend them somewhere else?  If the limiting factor is really money, couldn't we make all of society better off by adding more money?  You would ordinarily expect a healthy economy to be limited by its resources, by the available sand and heat for making glass: if the glazier replaces one window, he isn't replacing another.  Or if somebody works to provide the glazier with more sand and coal than he'd have otherwise had, to make more glass than he otherwise would've, then that's coal which isn't going to the smithy.\n\nOf course what Bastiat really meant is that sending resources to repair a broken window calls away those resources from somewhere else; and this is symbolized by the six francs being spent in one place rather than another.  That's how a modern economy works: when goods flow in one direction, money flows in the other direction.  So Bastiat talks about the change in a flow of francs, as a shorthand for talking about the corresponding change in a flow of goods.\n\nOkay, but what if the economy is in a depression?  What if the glazier was standing idle until the window was broken, and isn't being called away from any other job?  What if there's a ton of coal in an empty lot, waiting for someone to purchase it, and the reason nobody is purchasing it is that nobody seems to have any money?\n\nWell, in this case, it *still* doesn't help to go around breaking windows.  And Bastiat's original wording happens to precisely describe the resulting problem: the shopkeeper will *spend* six francs on the broken window and therefore not *spend* six francs on something else.  The money spent in one place, is then no longer available somewhere else, to animate a flow of goods moving in the opposite direction.\n\nThe only way we can imagine that breaking a window will help this economy, is if the shopkeeper has a buried chest of silver, and when somebody throws a rock through his window, the shopkeeper spends some of this buried silver, and then the shopkeeper *doesn't* try later to top off this chest of buried silver again.  Only in that hypothetical is there actually an additional six francs added to the economy, flowing to an otherwise idle glazier, who trades with a baker that wouldn't bake otherwise, who buys from a farmer who can afford to grow more crops than before.\n\nWould you agree with that statement -- with the paragraph as written above?  Standard economics says it is correct.\n\nBut this has now given us an even *more* astonishing implication:\n\nThis seems to say that we could just *print more money* and make the shopkeeper's town better off.  That's pretty much the same as digging up money from a buried chest and not replacing it, right?\n\n## More money, fewer problems?\n\n\"Now hold on,\" says the alert computer scientist, sitting bolt upright (and not without cause).  \"I know that society conditions us to think of these little rectangular pieces of paper as super valuable, but dollar bills or euro bills or whatever are just *symbols* for the actual goods and services that are actually valuable.  Thinking you can create more goods and services by creating more money is like counting your fingers, getting an answer of 10, erasing the 10 and writing down 11, and thinking you'll end up with 11 fingers.  Only you're *literally* doing that with writing down new numbers in bank accounts, versus the rest of the economy.  Money isn't wealth, it's a claim on wealth, and if you counterfeit $100 in your bank account, you're just making a false claim on wealth that someone else won't get.  Any theory that says you can create more wealth by creating more money, no matter how complicated the argument, will in the end turn out to be missing some row of the array that makes the numbers add up to zero; 'what is seen, and what is not seen', as Bastiat put it.\"\n\nAnd in a *healthy* economy, this would be correct.  But remember, those empty factories and that idle labor is not supposed to exist in the first place.   Is it so impossible that a weird condition that shouldn't exist, could be fixed by a weird tactic that shouldn't work?\n\n\"So what you're saying,\" says the skeptical computer scientist, \"is that the two impossibilities cancel out.  Like the story about the physics student who derived $E = -mc^2,$ and who gets told to next time try to make an even number of mistakes.\"\n\nWell, yes, pretty much.  First, let's consider a more ordinary exception to the rule that creating money can't help--the reason that money exists in the first place.\n\nSuppose that Alice, Bob, and Carol are as usual stuck on a deserted island.  Alice is growing apples, Bob grows bananas, and Carol grows cucumbers.  One day Alice wants a banana, Bob wants a cucumber, and Carol wants an apple; and they all go hungry because Alice doesn't have any cucumbers to trade to Bob for a banana.  Also they don't have computers on their deserted island, so they can't do anything clever like write software to detect cycles in people's available and desired goods.\n\nIn this case the standard solution for this lack of computing power is 'money'.  Creating money to add to this island, where there was no money at all before, actually does make the three people on the island better off.  They can legitimately end up better off by trading with each other, and the money causes more trades to occur than otherwise would.\n\nWhen an economy has idle factories and standing workers, it's in a state where more trades *could* occur, but aren't occurring.  Adding more money to that economy, to animate more trades, isn't far from what happens when we add money to an island that didn't have it.  The glazier spending another six francs dug up from the ground and not replaced later, which then flow to animate a trade with the baker in his mostly empty shop, and keeps circulating from there, can actually cause a larger number of trades to occur and make the economy actually wealthier.\n\nNow I have, indeed, pulled a bit of wool over your eyes with this argument.  The macroeconomic theory is waaaaay more complicated than this, in much the same way modern neural nets are a tad more complicated than just the idea of gradient descent.  But after we're done clipping gradients and initializing orthogonal weights and normalizing batches, in the end deep neural nets are *still* sliding down a loss gradient.  Similarly, it really looks in theory and in historical observation like an economy with idle resources, especially *unemployed workers,* can be made actually wealthier by creating more money.\n\nAnd that is--on the standard theory--why fractional reserve banks blowing up and destroying money and making fewer loans, cause there to be a bunch of unemployed people and fewer jobs and nobody being able to afford anything because none of their customers can afford to buy from them.  In a modern economy, for every flow of goods, there's money flowing the other way; and when you destroy money or slow down its flow, this can reduce the actual number of trades.\n\nTo give an idea of some of the complications we are blatantly skipping over: classical economics says that slowdown should not in fact happen, not to rational actors.  In a rational world, if somebody sets fire to half of the money supply, everyone just halves their prices and life goes on.\n\nThe reason our world is *not* like that ideal world where the prices just go down, is partially that there are outstanding loans denominated in the current currency, and existing contracts denominated in the current currency.  But *most* of the problem--according to the particular economic school I happen to subscribe to--is that people who set prices are *reluctant to lower them* in a way that an economy full of perfectly rational actors wouldn't be.\n\nAnd this is the kind of statement that causes fistfights between economists.\n\nSo there are certain alternate views here.\n\nBut there is indeed wisespread agreement that, for whatever reason, we don't live in the classical world of perfectly rational actors.  Which means that banks blowing up and thereby reducing the flow of money, can reduce the amount of flowing goods instead of prices dropping.  We are pretty sure from observation that this does in fact happen.\n\nAnd then, in that particular case, printing more money can help more trades occur and bring the economy closer to operating at real capacity.  Historical observation also *seems* to bear this out, although the near-impossibility of running real controlled experiments makes it hard to be sure.  The most recent case you might have heard about was in 2013 in the United States, where the \"sequester\" was going to produce a sharp cut in government spending just as the US was starting to recover a little bit, not completely, from the Great Recession.  Some people predicted the economy would tank again; and other people said it would be fine so long as the Federal Reserve created a correspondingly large amount of money, aka **monetary offset.**  And the sequester happened, and the Federal Reserve did in fact print a bunch of money, and pretty much nothing happened to the economy.  Amazing proof, right?\n\nOkay, so that's not a very detailed observation if you're used to getting 127GB of training data any time you feel like it.  But it was in fact an experimental test of two different predictions, and the economists who thought in terms of flowing money were right; and in the end, that's all we have in this life.\n\n## The general glut\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes -- I know some of you hate him, but he was a respected economist and he came up with a clever illustration, so please bear with me -- John Maynard Keynes once came up with a clever illustration of what could possibly cause anything as weird as a recession, and how this could possibly be fixed by anything as weird as printing money.\n\nSuppose that on an island, Alice and Bob and Carol are growing apples and oranges and pomegranites.  Furthermore, as in the Great Depression, it is not yet the case that everyone has enough to eat.\n\nIn this situation, could there be an excess supply or \"glut\" of apples?  Alice and Bob, who both grow apples, could have had such a large apple harvest that people on the island prefer to eat other, scarcer fruits if those are available.  In this case we'd see the relative value of apples, compared to other fruits, dropping.  Maybe 1 apple used to be worth 1 orange and 1 pomegranite, and now somebody would only trade 1 orange or 1 pomegranite for 2 apples.  Alice and Bob would be wise to shift more of their effort to growing oranges and pomegranites, going forward.\n\nWe could indeed call this a \"glut\" of apples, which (so long as people don't have *all* the food they want) describes a *relative* excess of supply of apples, compared to the supply/demand balance of other fruits.  To say that apples are now cheaper in terms of oranges, is equally to say that oranges have become more expensive in terms of apples.\n\nBut is it possible to have a glut of *every kind of fruit at once?*  While Alice and Bob and Carol would still individually prefer to eat more, that is?  How could that be (asked Keynes)?  You can't have *each* fruit being ultra-cheap as denominated in all the other fruits.  Then what are we to think of a supposed situation in which Alice and Bob and Carol are still not full, but they are cutting back on growing apples *and* oranges *and* pomegranites, because they have too much of all of them?\n\nHow is it possible for a whole economy to be suffering from a problem of \"excess supply\" where factories in general are going idle?\n\nAnd the answer (said Keynes) is that the only way this \"general glut\" can happen is if there is some additional, invisible good that people are demanding more than apples and oranges *and* pomegranites; so that the values of apples and oranges *and* pomegranites are all falling relative to the value of this invisible good.  And the way that this can happen in real life (said Keynes) is if Alice and Bob and Carol have invented a fourth, invisible good called money.\n\nThat is: it's the weird symbolic nature of money as an artificial good, that allows recessions and Depressions to happen in the first place.  Which is why the books can in fact balance, when we try to fix a recession by creating more money.\n\nI haven't heard the phrase \"general glut\" used outside of textbooks, but it's still a neat illustration.\n\n## Aggregate demand and monetary stimulus\n\nWhen economists talk about this sort of thing, they've been known to use the phrase \"**aggregate demand**\".\n\nActual human wants are, if not infinite, then certainly a lot higher than the total amount of stuff produced by the world economy!  We don't all have mansions, at least not yet.  So what \"aggregate demand\" really means is more like \"aggregate purchasing power\", which in turn means \"total amount of flowing money trying to buy all the goods\".  \n\nThe standard economic view can then be stated compactly: when the financial system blows up and a recession occurs and people get unemployed and factories go empty, what's happening is an \"**aggregate demand deficit**\"; in other words, there isn't enough purchasing power to buy all the stuff the economy could supply.\n\nOne reason this happens is because the exploding banks (or, nowadays, banks that get bailed out but are less enthusiastic about making more loans afterwards) reduce the \"**money supply**\" - one reason there's less money flowing and fewer corresponding trades, is because there's less actual money.\n\nAnother reason aggregate demand decreases, is that people also want to *hold on* to more money during a depression or a recession.  This decreases **monetary velocity.**\n\nWhen all this is starting to go wrong inside a country, conventional economics says that the central bank ought to immediately swing into action and create more money, aka \"**monetary stimulus**\".  (Or rather, the central bank is supposed to create money and use it to buy government bonds or something, and then hold onto the bonds.  Later on, when monetary velocity picks up, the central bank sells the bonds and destroys the money it previously created, to avoid creating too much inflation.  They're supposed to do \"**temporary monetary stimulus**\" in order to regularize the ongoing flow of all money.)\n\nIf the Federal Reserve thinks it *can't* create enough money, then it is alleged that the government can sell treasury bonds for money, spend the resulting money, and then people still have bonds which satisfy some of the same desire to hold assets.  This is \"**fiscal stimulus**\" and whether it is ever a good idea to do this is another one of those questions that cause economists to get into fistfights.  (I personally happen to side with the school that goes around saying, \"What do you mean, the central bank *can't create enough money* to stabilize the aggregate flow of currency and the number of trades occurring?  Did you run out of ones and zeroes?\")\n\nIt's possible that there's some way to solve this problem without central banks, yes, I know, 13% of you are right this minute trying to figure out some way to do it using a blockchain.  But right now countries do have central banks; and taking that as a fact at least for now, that's what conventional economic theory says central banks ought to do.\n\nAll of this is, in net, one reason why when people start worrying about technological unemployment due to AI advances, one of the obvious other things that you need to do on the side of whatever else you're doing -- really *really* need to do, actually, all this has a *huge* impact on the economy -- is worry about making sure that there is, in national economies as a whole, *enough money for people to buy things.*\n\nIt is in fact very possible for the economy to end up in a state where most people feel poor, and can't afford to buy things from each other, and go around being sad and out of work, such that you could in fact cause everyone to perk up and trade with each other and be happy again *by letting everyone have more money.*  (Simultaneously!  Not just moving money around as happens with basic income.)  If everyone thinks they're poor and can't afford to work for each other, despite there being an adequate supply of factories and things people want, you can sometimes fix the problem by, in effect, letting everyone just be rich instead.  If you saw lots of people standing around doing nothing after advances in automation, that would be the *first* thing you tried.\n\nIt's not agreed among economists which countries are presently suffering from too little aggregate demand, and working under capacity.  The economists in my preferred school suspect that it is presently happening inside the European Union due to the European Central Bank being run by lunatics.  Most economists think the United States is *not* currently bounded by an aggregate demand deficit, or running far under capacity.  I myself feel a bit unsure about that; sometimes it really seems like we could all be much happier if we all just simultaneously decided to be 10% richer.  Or that, say, Arizona, would actually benefit a *lot* from having its own currency to use on the side, until everyone there was working for everyone else.  But I haven't really paid enough attention to this area, and you probably shouldn't listen to me.\n\nI'm going to temporarily stop going on about this because there's other economic concepts I want to run through and I don't want to risk boring you about that; but I'm going to pick this up in a later section about \"NGDP level targeting.\"  For now, I just want to note that, compared to reforming labor markets, it can actually be a lot simpler to print more ones and zeroes in the central bank, and central banks are not completely unwilling to hear about it.  It's arguably an excellent choice for what we should try to fix *first.*\n\n# Gently sloping supply curves, and skyrocketing prices\n\nBy now you might be picking up a general sense of a not-that-bad post-automation state which seems like *in theory* it shouldn't be that hard to achieve.  *If* things are happening in a very reasonable way, the way that simplified economics theories talk about before they start getting complicated.\n\nYou could look further ahead than I think we're actually going to get -- not because I don't think AI can get that far, quite the opposite really, but still -- and imagine a world where human beings... are still trading with each other.\n\nA world where at least it doesn't happen, that Alice knows how to grow food, and Bob knows how to build houses, and they're both going around cold and hungry because agriculture and house-building have been automated.\n\nYou can imagine a world where, okay, some of the dignity has been lost, and some of the remaining jobs aren't as awesome as when people were forging refrigerators out of raw steel with their bare hands.  But people still want things and other people still do them.\n\nA world where we at least haven't just wantonly *defined* ourselves into poverty, where, okay, robots exist, but people also have money in their bank accounts.\n\nA world where people have as at least as much dignity as they'd have in 1960.  Because logically, any given group could always draw a line around themselves and go back to 1960s technology.  And if that group then *removes* the line, starts trading with others, and adds more technology, life should only get better for them from there, because of Ricardo's Law of Comparative Advantage.  Right?\n\nThere are a number of obvious problems that could completely blow up this scenario, and why modern life for a heck of a lot of people in fact looks nothing like this.\n\nIn particular, if there's any good X that people *really* need, and that stays extremely expensive in the face of automation.  Then it doesn't matter of a region tries to print its own currency to maintain trade, people still end up being poor; because it takes months and months of babysitting to afford one unit of good X.\n\nA good like, say, *housing, health care,* or *college,* all of which have been skyrocketing in price seemingly without limit over the last few decades.\n\nFor an overview of the enormous problem, I would recommend Slate Star's \"[Considerations on Cost Disease](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/)\".  For example, it turns out that the United States spends around $4000 per citizen on Medicaid and Medicare and insurance subsidies, and that $4000 is around what other countries pay for *universal* coverage; it's not that the United States is unwilling to pay for universal coverage, but that somehow healthcare costs far more in the United States (without any discernibly improved medical outcomes, of course).\n\nYou can find various graphs showing that all of the increased productivity over the last 20 years has been sucked up by increasing housing prices.  Or that all of the missing wages, as productivity rises and wages stay flat, can be accounted for by the cost of health care.  I can't recall seeing a graph like that for college costs and student debt, but it sure ain't cheap.  If all of those graphs are true simultaneously, and they are, well, you can see why people might be feeling increasingly impoverished even if their nominal wages in dollars are theoretically flat.\n\nAnd if things like that went on happening while a hypothetical tidal wave of automation was crashing in... then that would certainly smash any utopian vision of people continuing to trade with each other while all the real prices dropped.\n\nThere are various aspects of this that economists will still get into fistfights over, so I can't just hand you a standard analysis.  But if I look for standard economics concepts that are definitely *relevant* to parsing the problem, and that have some standardly predicted consequences that go mysteriously missing from political conversations...\n\n## Supply and demand functions\n\nSupply and demand are always equal.\n\nIf we look at all the loaves of bread sold in a city on Monday, then, on that Monday, the number of loaves of bread sold, and the number of loaves bought, are equal to one another.  Every time a loaf of bread is sold, there's one person selling the loaf and one person buying a loaf.\n\nImagining supply not equaling demand is like imagining a collection of nonoverlapping line segments with an odd number of endpoints.\n\nOr that's how economists technically define the words \"supply\" and \"demand\", anyway.  So what use is such a merely tautologous equation?\n\nWell, it lets economists talk about **supply curves** and **demand curves,** which go as a function of prices.  Or to be snootier, **supply functions** and **demand functions.**  The point at which the two curves *meet* - since *supply and demand are always equal* - tells us the price level.\n\nBut if supply equals demand by definition, then how would we talk about the old days of the Soviet Union, where there were 1000 people who wanted toilet paper and only 400 rolls of toilet paper?  And it was illegal for the store to raise the set price of toilet paper?  In this case, didn't demand just directly exceed supply?\n\nWhat one actually sees in a Soviet supermarket is a long line of people waiting outside before the store opens, trying to get to the toilet paper before it's gone.  An economist would regard the *time spent in line* as part of the 'price' of a roll of toilet paper.  No matter how the demand curve slopes--no matter how much people want toilet paper--the time required to stand in line will increase until 600 people give up and go home.  And then the monetary price of the toilet paper, *plus* the time required to stand in line, is the \"price\" at which the demand function meets the supply function.\n\nThis wasn't good for the Soviet Union because the time spent in line was burned, destroyed, in a way that produced nothing.  When the price is allowed to go up, under capitalism, the successful buyers may indeed spend more money; but just passing that money around doesn't destroy wealth the way that standing in line destroys time.  The flip side is that everyone ultimately has an equal supply of time and not everyone has an equal supply of money; poorer people *can* sometimes benefit relative to non-poor people when part of a good is repriced in time rather than money.  (Naturally, sufficiently rich people just hire someone else to stand in line.)\n\nIf you set up a cart selling $20 bills for $1 each, a line will form in front of the cart and extend until it's long enough to burn $18.99 worth of the time of people who could otherwise earn the least amount of money per hour.  You can't *actually* sell $20 bills, to anyone who wants them, at a price of $1, and have that be the real, full price.\n\nA similar dynamic plays out every year when the organizers of Burning Man once again try to defy the laws of logic as well as capitalism in order to sell 70,000 tickets at a fixed price of $500, with resale at higher prices resulting in your tickets being pulled at the last minute if Burning Man finds out about it... to way more than 70,000 people willing to pay significantly more than $500.  (I've heard it suggested that, in this case, the real \"price\" is pulling on your social connections in order to obtain Burning Man tickets for a nominal price of $500, via trading favors with people who were savvy enough to sign up for the sales lottery.  Thus selecting socially savvy people to attend Burning Man.)\n\n## When subsidy is futile and will be assimilated\n\nImagine a city under siege, where there are only 3,000 loaves of bread to be had, and each loaf is selling for 2 golden crowns.  Can the governor of the city ease the plight of the people by ordering the treasury to pay 1 golden crown for loaf?  The people will still be hungry -- there's still only so much bread to go around -- but perhaps at least their *financial* pain can be eased?\n\nNo, in fact.  The price of the 3,000 loaves of bread rises until all but 3,000 people drop out of the market for purchasing it.  If there are 3,000 people willing to pay 2 golden crowns for a loaf of bread, and the governor steps in and says the city will pay 1 golden crown per loaf of the price, then there will be 3,000 people willing to pay 2 golden crowns plus 1 golden crown subsidy.  The price of each loaf rises to 3 crowns, and the 3,000 people buying it are 2 golden crowns out of pocket, the same as before.\n\nIn economitalk, we'd say that the supply was **inflexible,** in other words, the supply curve was horizontal with respect to price; no matter how much more people paid (the x axis), the supply of bread stayed the same (the y axis).  The demand curve does slope, in this example; it slopes downward with increasing price, until it crosses the flat supply curve at a price point of 2 golden crowns.\n\nIf the governor then adds a subsidy of 1 golden crown to each purchase of bread, we are in effect *shifting the demand curve to the right* along the x-axis - the demand for bread at 2 golden crowns, is now the higher demand level we would have previously seen at a price of 1 golden crown.  We have had a change of variables: Demand(x') = Demand(x - 1 crown).  Since the supply curve is flat, this just means that the two curves meet at a price' which is 1 golden crown greater than the old price.\n\nIn other words:  It doesn't help any buyers to try to subsidize a good in inflexible supply.  The only way subsidies can *possibly* help buyers *at all,* is if increasing the price of the good causes more of the good to exist.\n\n## Skyrocketing prices\n\nA price skyrockets when...\n\n(drum roll)\n\n...a gently sloping demand curve meets a gently sloping supply curve.\n\nIf the demand curve slopes sharply downward, the price can't increase very far, because this describes a state of affairs where, as the price of the good increases, lots of people *rapidly* become unwilling to pay and drop out of the market before the price has moved very far.\n\nIf the supply curve slopes sharply upward, the price can't increase very far.  As the price goes up, the market is rapidly flooded with more sellers seeking to produce the good.\n\nSo if the city of San Francisco refuses to build more than a handful of apartments, and a large number of people in search of jobs *really* want to live in San Francisco and do *not* want to be driven out even as prices go up... we shall see prices skyrocket; until, however reluctantly, the least wealthy people among the excess demanders are driven out of the Bay Area.\n\n\"I already knew that,\" you say.  Okay, but now consider health care and college.\n\nIn the United States there are, if I recall correctly, only 350 people allowed to become orthodontists every year.\n\nFor as long as that stays true--and we are talking about a deeply entrenched system here--it can accomplish literally nothing to try to subsidize orthodontics.  You cannot cause more poor children to have braces by having the government offer to pay for their orthodontia.  Orthodontic colleges have decided to graduate 350 orthodontists per year and turn down all other applicants, and those 350 people can only put braces on a limited number of patients.  No amount of shuffling money around or tweaking insurance regulations can allow *more* people to have braces than that.\n\nOnce upon a time, the US government passed a GI bill and, in fact, a lot more people went to college.  So there must have been more colleges springing up, or existing colleges must have expanded to serve more students.  That's the only possible way that a lot more people could have ended up going to college.\n\nLater, it seemed like there still weren't enough people going to college.  So the US government offered to subsidize loan insurance in order to allow more students to get loans to pay for college.  And now US college prices have skyrocketed and people are leaving college with a crippling, immiserating load of student debt.\n\nSo: by the second time around, there was some kind of increased barrier or difficulty to starting a new college, or at least starting the kind of college that anyone actually wanted to go to.  We also infer that people *really really* wanted to go to college, and moreover, go to a non-horrible college with a reputation, instead of a new for-profit college that nobody had heard about.  And that existing reputable colleges were unwilling or unable to expand.  Otherwise the price couldn't have gone up.\n\nYou can't subsidize housing unless higher housing prices can cause there to be more housing.  You can't subsizide college unless higher tuitions can cause new (desirable) colleges to spring up or old colleges to expand.  There's literally nothing you can do to cause more people to have more healthcare by moving around insurance premiums, unless the resulting higher prices are causing more doctors and more hospitals to exist.\n\nThis isn't a simple issue, obviously.  The main oddity I'd like to observe is this: that politicians only ever talk about demand and prices, who gets to purchase and how much they pay, and they usually discuss supply not at all.\n\n## Supply and demand in politics.\n\nIf you were around for the 2008 Presidential election in the US, there was this lovely case where some gasoline refineries had broken down, and thus the US was experiencing a gasoline shortage with sharply rising prices.  And there was a proposal to temporarily repeal some gasoline taxes...\n\n...which would have been a *pure gift* to gasoline refineries.  The total supply of gasoline was price-unresponsive; it couldn't go up until refineries were built or repaired.  It was pretty much the city under seige in which you got 3000 loaves of bread per day, period.\n\nAnd so pretty much every academic economist in the United States, Republican and Democrat alike, was saying, \"This will not change prices at the pump.  It won't even cause gas stations to make more money.  Literally the only people who benefit from shifting this demand curve to the right are the owners of gasoline refineries.\"\n\nJohn McCain was in favor of temporarily lifting the tax.  Hillary Clinton was in favor of lifting the tax.  In an extraordinary moment that stunned all of us who knew economics, Barack Obama came out *against* lifting the tax.\n\nOnly Obama couldn't actually say outright:  \"McCain and Clinton certainly know as well as I do why this measure would be futile, but they think most of the electorate is too stupid to understand the most elementary possible economic points that involve literally any abstraction whatsoever; and therefore McCain and Clinton don't dare publicly oppose decreased gas taxes while everyone is angry about gas prices.\"\n\nI don't know if it's true that it will always be impossible to talk about the limited number of orthodontists graduated when talking about subsidizing braces; but if almost all the politicians *believe* that voters won't understand and will get angry, it amounts to the same outcome, whether voters would actually get angry or not.\n\nI haven't the tiniest idea about how to solve this problem.  Maybe you do.\n\nAnyway, the point is, the *cost disease* across housing, education, and above all, medicine, is a big darned problem that can smash an otherwise pleasant outcome where everything gets cheaper as a result of automation and this causes people not to become effectively poor.  I have no idea how you can solve this, but you *can't* solve it by advocating for more government subsidies or trying to move existing subsidies around.  To make costs come down again, you need to either (a) make people stop wanting surgeons, bachelors' degrees, and bedrooms; or (b) you need to somehow make more of those things exist, in a world where supply is not already increasing just because the price is skyrocketing.",

      "text": "This is a FAQ aimed at a very rapid introduction to key standard economic concepts to professionals in AI and machine learning who have become concerned with the potential economic impacts of their work, or who want to participate in conversations about the economic impact of present and future Artificial Intelligence.\n\nYou will in fact need a strong intuitive understanding of \"comparative advantage\", and several other key concepts, to talk sensibly about a declining labor force participation rate and what ought to be done about it.  Just like you yourself might perhaps feel a bit frustrated when trying to discuss which professions are liable to be automated in the near future, with somebody who doesn't understand the notion of gradient descent and why some human jobs have loss functions that are harder to measure and differentiate.  It's not that the concepts are mathematically hard in an absolute sense, it's that you really do need to be parsing the world using those basic concepts.  I won't belabor this point any further.\n\nWithout further ado, here's a quick list of some concepts that this particular author thinks are important:\n\n- **Comparative advantage** says that even if Alice is less efficient (less productive) at all of her tasks than is Bob, Alice and Bob still both benefit from being able to trade with one another.\n - If Alice is *relatively* twice as good at growing apples than she is at growing oranges, and Bob is relatively twice as good at growing oranges than growing apples, Alice and Bob can both benefit by trading her apples for his oranges, even if Bob can grow 10 times as many apples per unit of labor than Alice.\n- The **lump of labour fallacy** is the standard term for the (appealing but incorrect) reasoning which says that if you automate away 95% of the jobs, only 5% of the people remain employed.\n - Humanity did in fact automate away 95% of all labor during the industrial revolution - 98% of the population used to be farmers, and now it's 3% - and yet more than 5% of the people still have jobs.\n - The standard explanation for why we aren't all already unemployed revolves around **complementary inputs:** if it previously took 20 units of labor to make 10 hot dogs and 10 units of labor to make 10 hot dog buns, and then hot-dog-making productivity doubles, the classically predicted new equilibrium is 15 hot dogs and 15 hot dog buns.\n - Maybe this is, in fact, not what is happening right now.  But it's definitely what happened during most of human history, and you need to intuitively understand the background classical prediction in order to *not* just try to reinterpret the present situation through the eyes of the lump of labour fallacy.\n- The *broken window fallacy** is the standard term for the (appealing but incorrect) reasoning which says that if you heave a rock through somebody's window, they have to pay the glazier to repair the window, and the glazier buys bread from the baker, and so production thrives and everybody is better off.\n - The key to understanding *why* this is a fallacy will revolve around the concept of **aggregate demand**.  Under normal conditions the economy should be bounded by the available supply of glass and similar goods, and destroying goods in one place diverts them from somewhere else.  Modern economies *can* get into wedged states where glaziers are sitting idle; and the economy is then bounded by a different quantity, the amount of flowing money available to animate trades.  But heaving a rock through a window doesn't increase this quantity either.\n- When a good has a relatively low-sloped **supply curve** (curve for supply versus price), subsidizing that good will tend to increase its price much more than the amount of that good.\n - If you make it easier for people to take out loans to go to universities, but it's not very easy to build lots of new universities, the result is that people end up with a lot of student loan debt.\n- \"Inequality\" in a bad sense usually results from **rent extraction.**  Under some conditions, equilibrium extractible rents sometimes only go up when people's incomes would otherwise rise.\n - Reading articles written by actual poor people in the US gives the strong impression that one's top priority for helping them ought to be outlawing towing fees.\n - This is one potential thing that might go wrong with the basic income.  It might possibly just cause the Ferguson Police Department to issue more tickets, unless you fix the Ferguson Police Department first.\n - Excessive intellectual property protection can also cause excess concentration of rents.\n - Economies of scale in dealing with regulators -- being able to afford lawyers -- can effectively protect big companies from competition and enable them to extract monopoly rents.\n- **Labor market flexibility** (aka the ability of people to move around and match up with available jobs) is a critical factor in employment.  This can be hindered by e.g. restrictions on building more housing in cities with high labor demand.\n - We could equally view this as due to major employers continuing to situate new jobs in the cities with already-skyrocketing housing prices.  (One observes that, often, these housing costs are relatively far less burdensome on the high-level decision makers who decide where to put the company.)\n- **Effective marginal tax rates** are how much benefit accrues to somebody who earns 1 more dollar at their current wage level.  Not just due to income taxes and payroll taxes, but also due to phasing-out of benefits, it's possible for somebody who earns +$1 to be effectively +$0.20 better off, or even for this number to go negative.\n - Current estimates of effective marginal tax rates in low income brackets are usually in the range of 70% and on many 'cliffs' higher than 100%.\n- Alternatives to minimum wage include **wage subsidies.**\n - We can consider the minimum wage as a subsidy on wages paid for by a marginal tax on employers who hire people at less than the minimum wage.  If society thinks this subsidy is a good idea, it should almost certainly not be paid for by those particular employers.\n- Alternatives to labor taxes include **land value tax** and **consumption taxes.**\n - If you tax labor, you'll discourage labor.  Taxing the implicit rents on land doesn't cause there to be less land, so it's a less distortive tax.\n- **Sticky prices** of labor, especially **downward sticky** wages, cause small amounts of deflation to do far more damage to economies than small amounts of deflation.\n - This is one reason why modern economics suggests trying to stabilize an economy at 2% inflation rather than 0% inflation; small amounts of inflation help prices adjust to new realities over time.\n - There's an up-and-coming view, not yet fully adopted, which rephrases the view as being about the total amount of flowing money, and says that people lose their jobs when there isn't enough flowing money to pay their wages.  This view suggests that the best help monetary policy can give to employment is **targeting a price level** of **per-capita NGDP.**\n\nMany readers will also have common ideas about:\n\n- Regulatory burdens on employers decreasing employment.\n- \"Regulatory capture\" by large corporations influencing regulators to make it harder for new entrants to compete with them.\n- Regulatory compliance costs generally decreasing economic productivity.\n\nThere is not universal agreement on how large these problems are, or whether they should be top priorities.  But standard economics does not regard these ideas as *naive,* so I won't discuss them any further in this FAQ.  My purpose here is to introduce relatively more technical concepts, that are more likely to be new to the reader, and that refute appealing-sounding views that are widely regarded by professional economists as being misguided on technical grounds.\n\nThis document is currently incomplete, and the Table of Contents below shows what is currently covered.\n\n[toc:]\n\n# Comparative advantage, and the mercantilist fallacy\n\nRicardo's Law of Comparative Advantage says that parties (individuals, groups, countries) can both benefit from trading with each other, even when one party is *strictly more productive* than the other.\n\n- Suppose Alice can produce 20 apples per unit of labor, and 10 oranges per unit of labor.\n- Bob can produce 50 apples per unit of labor, and 100 oranges per unit of labor.\n- Alice and Bob both have 10 units of labor to use.\n\nIf Alice wants an equal number of apples and oranges, she's better off producing 200 apples with all of her labor, and then trading 100 of the apples to Bob for 100 oranges.\n\nBob in turn is better off producing 100 oranges with 1 unit of labor, and trading them to Alice for 100 apples, than Bob would be if he used 2 units of labor to produce 100 apples directly.\n\nEconomists usually regard this idea as refuting some intuitive ideas about *mercantilism,* which says that countries are better off the more they sell, and worse off the more they buy.\n\nAnother possibly-not-intuitive consequence of comparative advantage is that, except for *sticky prices* (see below), the exchange rates on a country's currency have little long-run effect on its trade.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- Germany buys 100,000 dollars from the US for 100,000 euros;\n- Germany then uses these 100,000 dollars to buy 100 air conditioners from the US;\n- People in the US use their 100,000 euros to buy 10 cars from Germany.\n\nSuppose the European Central Bank then prints twice as many euros and credibly commits to never buy them back, cutting the value of its currency in half.  Then:\n\n- People in Germany buy 100,000 dollars from people in the US, using 200,000 euros.\n- People in Germany buy 100 air conditioners from the US.\n- People in the US buy 10 cars from Germany, each of which now costs twice as much, for a total of 200,000 euros.\n\nRoughly, Ricardo's Law suggests that we view the US as shipping 100 air conditioners to Germany in exchange for 10 cars, with the monetary exchange rates being something of an epiphenomenon.  In practice this is modified by \"sticky prices\" in that some people already own euros or dollars, or bonds denominated in euros or dollars, and there are existing sales contracts that fix prices for a term.  But most models have effects like this washing out over the long run.\n\nThe concept of comparative advantage is important for discussing technological unemployment because it conveys the general idea that when we draw a line around a group or region, like \"Alice\" or \"Wisconsin\", this region is not harmed by being able to trade with someone else who is much more productive than them (never mind getting their own advanced technology).\n\nThis isn't to say that technological advances can't ever hurt Wisconsin's economy.  Maybe Wisconsin is trading cheese to Ohio in exchange for coal.  One day, Michigan becomes much more efficient than Wisconsin at producing cheese, causing Ohio to start trading with Michigan instead.  This can hurt Wisconsin's economy, quite a lot.  The conclusion from Ricardo's Law is rather that Wisconsin can't be harmed by the fact of Wisconsin *itself* being allowed to trade with Michigan.  What hurts Wisconsin in this scenario is that *Ohio* is allowed to trade with Michigan.  Wisconsin can only make itself even worse off by hindering its own trade with Michigan.\n\nIf Wisconsin closes its borders and tries to get along in its own little world that doesn't include those awful new cheese-making machines, Ricardo's Law says that Wisconsin as a whole *should* become worse-off thereby.  If this stops being true, then some unusual phenomenon must be at work, one that violates the broad axioms under which Ricardo's Law is a theorem.\n\n(An intuition I'll be trying to promote over this FAQ is that the state of affairs over most of human history, in which technological automation made most people better off without causing them to be permanently unemployed, is a very normal state of affairs from the standpoint of economic theory.  If we're currently looking at lasting unemployment caused by automation, this is a *surprising* state of affairs.  And the reason for it won't be that Ricardo's Law suddenly stopped being a theorem, but rather that something relatively new is going on that wasn't happening during the Industrial Revolution.  And whatever the truth turns out to be, Ricardo's Law will still be a relatively better lens than mercantilism through which to understand it.)\n\n# Complementary inputs, and the lump of labour fallacy\n\nSuppose that:\n\n- People like to eat sausages in buns.\n- Each sausage-in-a-bun requires 1 sausage and 1 bun as an input, and a trivial amount of labor to assemble.\n- At present, it requires 1 unit of labor to make a bun, and 2 units of labor to make a sausage.\n- The resulting equilibrium involves 10 sausages-in-a-bun being manufactured by 30 people expending 30 units of labor.\n\nBroadly speaking, the \"lump of labour\" fallacy says that there's a limited amount of work to be done in the world, and a limited number of jobs to go around, and every time one of those jobs is automated away, one more person ends up unemployed.\n\nSo the question then becomes: if we invent a new kind of sausage-making machine that doubles productivity and makes it possible to produce 2 sausages using 2 units of labor, do we...\n\n- End up with 10-sausages-in-a-bun produced by 20 people, and 10 unemployed former sausage makers?\n- End up with 15-sausages-in-a-bun produced by 30 people?\n\nEnding up in the second equilibrium, maybe not right away, is widely regarded as the core idea behind how we could start with a world where 98% of the population were farmers, improving agricultural productivity by a factor of 100 between then and now, and end up with a world in which 3% of the people are farmers and the other 95% of the population are *not* unemployed.\n\nOne way of looking at this is that, over the course of human history so far, *everything* has behaved like it is complementary.  When agricultural productivity skyrocketed, a bunch of people went into making shoes and clothes and tables and houses, and the end result was that more people had food, more people had more nice clothes and furniture, and not everyone in the world was unemployed.  The \"food\" input to a human became cheaper, and labor went into making more of the \"clothes\" and \"furniture\" inputs to humans.  When manufacturing productivity skyrocketed, people went into services.\n\nNow it could be that this phenomenon is now breaking down for any number of possible reasons.  It seems relatively *implausible* that we have reached *the end of demand* and that all the people now have enough of every kind of good and service that they want.  There are way too many poor and unhappy people still in the world for that to be true!\n\nOkay, so we haven't reached the end of human wants.  But maybe some people in the modern world can no longer produce *anything* that other people want...?\n\nI'd like to encourage you to regard this idea with some surprise, especially the notion that this \"unnecessariat\" exists today, *before* we can reliably build a robot that cleans a dishwasher and puts away the dishes without breaking them.  AI is making progress, but we haven't exactly *finished* conquering par-human perception and motor skills.  Are there really people in the world who can do *nothing* that *anybody* else wants?\n\nHeck, why can't those people trade with *each other*?  If they can at least help each other, and get their own economy going, doesn't Ricardo's Law say that this state of affairs ought to provide a *floor* on their economic activity, and that the group can only benefit further by trading with other groups outside themselves...?\n\nWhy isn't it a theorem that there's never any involuntary employment?  I would encourage you to stare at this result and try to feel surprised by the modern state of the world in which unemployment exists.  It's not that theorems get to overrule reality; but they do say that *more* must be going on than there being a limited lump of human want, a correspondingly limited lump of jobs, and not enough jobs for all the people.\n\nAnother view might suggest that the axioms of classical economics are actually pretty fragile, and it's no surprise if the \"nobody in the world should be unemployed\" theorem fails to hold.  In particular, in a world where there's a minimum cost or minimum danger to hiring someone, people may not be able to produce anything that is worth the minimum cost and danger to their employer.\n\n- If you are a neoliberal, you are likely to think about minimum wages, payroll taxes, occupational licensing, and regulatory burdens.\n- If you are Tyler Cowen, you will worry that some people in the labor pool are actively destructive; that lawsuits have made it harder for employers to use word-of-mouth to blackball destructive people; and that people who have been unemployed for a while, end up in a global pool of people who on *average* have \"zero marginal productivity\", within which employers cannot afford or cannot be bothered to distinguish the positively-productive.\n\nOr if you are of a more leftist persuasion, you may worry that the billionaires are running out of real wants, and that the people who *do* want things are defined by our economy as not having enough money to buy them.\n\nOr if you are a Georgist, you are liable to observe that \"unemployed\" people can't build houses for each other and can't farm food for each other, because the government has decided that they own zero land and aren't allowed to get started anywhere; and to regard this as the real core of the problem.\n\nThere are more than enough possible hypotheses to explain why unemployed people can possibly exist.  But it's also worth noting that there was less lasting unemployment in, say, 1850.  What changed between then and now could be all the regulations saying you can't just go build somebody a house, or it could be increased inequality, or it could be housing prices preventing people from moving to California where there are jobs.  The point is that the problem is *not* that there's only so many jobs in the global lump and AI advances are destroying them.\n\nIt could indeed be that existing AI, and to a much larger degree, ordinary computer programming, have gone a long way towards devaluing many kinds of work that can be done without a high school degree.  And it's definitely possible that, on the margins, AI conquering more perceptual and motor tasks will make *more* people permanently unemployed.\n\nIt's reasonable for people in AI to feel concerned about this, and want to do something to make things better.\n\nBut it's important to be aware that the issue is *not* the end of human want, or the running-out of the lump of labor.  It's important to keep in mind that the issue may not *intrinsically* be that some people have nothing at all to contribute to any remaining human want, but that we've put obstacles in the way of people being allowed to contribute.\n\nAnyway: however you want to look at the situation, and whatever solution you propose, please don't talk about AI or trade or automation \"destroying jobs,\" because it will cause any economists listening you to scream in silent horror that they cannot give voice.\n\n# The broken window fallacy, and aggregate demand\n\n## Surprisingly, recessions turn out to exist\n\nIn theory, when we double the productivity of sausage-makers, we should get 15 sausages-in-buns instead of 10.  We should not get 10 unemployed sausage-makers; or, if we temporarily get 10 unemployed sausage-makers, that state of affairs shouldn't last longer than it takes sausage-makers to become willing to look for work at the booming bun factories with HELP WANTED signs plastered all over their windows.\n\nAnd yet there seem to be these occasions, like the \"Great Depression\" or the \"Great Recession\", when there are silent factories and people standing idle, or the modern equivalent.  The unemployed sausage-makers are willing to look for new jobs, but there aren't tons of HELP WANTED signs to let them get started on retraining.  The bun factories are actually making fewer buns, because now the unemployed sausage-makers aren't buying sausages-in-a-bun anymore.\n\nOne will observe, however, that these historical occasions seem to come on suddenly, and *not* due to sudden brilliant inventions causing a huge jump in productivity.  They happen at around the same time that there's trouble in the financial system--banks blowing up.\n\nFurthermore, the number of idle factories and amount of idle labor seems to be far in excess of what could reasonably be accounted for by sausage-makers needing to change jobs.  And even people with what might seem like very useful skills, can't find anywhere to put them to use.  None of the previous reasons we've considered, for why unemployment could possibly exist, seem to apply to how *that* much unemployment could exist in the Great Depression.  And then a decade later all those people had jobs again, too; so it wasn't something intrinsic to the people or the jobs that caused them to be unemployed for so long.\n\nThat is weird and astonishing!  If your brain doesn't currently think that is weird and astonishing, please try at least briefly to get yourself into the state of mind where it is.\n\n## The broken window fallacy\n\nAs my entry point into explaining this astonishing paradox, I'm going to take an unusual angle and start with the **broken window fallacy.**\n\nThe broken window fallacy was originally pointed out in 1850 by Frederic Bastiat, in a now-famous essay, \"[That Which Is Seen, And That Which Is Not Seen](http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html)\"  Bastiat begins with the parable of a child who has accidentally thrown a rock through somebody's window:\n\n> Have you ever witnessed the anger of the good shopkeeper, James B., when his careless son happened to break a square of glass? If you have been present at such a scene, you will most assuredly bear witness to the fact, that every one of the spectators, were there even thirty of them, by common consent apparently, offered the unfortunate owner this invariable consolation — \"It is an ill wind that blows nobody good. Everybody must live, and what would become of the glaziers if panes of glass were never broken?\"\n\nAnd doesn't the glazier, in turn, spend money at the baker, and the shoemaker, and the baker and shoemaker spend money at the mill and tannery?  Doesn't all of society end up benefiting from this broken window?\n\n> Now, this form of condolence contains an entire theory, which it will be well to show up in this simple case, seeing that it is precisely the same as that which, unhappily, regulates the greater part of our economical institutions.\n\n> Suppose it cost six francs to repair the damage, and you say that the accident brings six francs to the glazier's trade — that it encourages that trade to the amount of six francs — I grant it; I have not a word to say against it; you reason justly. The glazier comes, performs his task, receives his six francs, rubs his hands, and, in his heart, blesses the careless child. All this is that which is seen.\n\n> But if, on the other hand, you come to the conclusion, as is too often the case, that it is a good thing to break windows, that it causes money to circulate, and that the encouragement of industry in general will be the result of it, you will oblige me to call out, \"Stop there! your theory is confined to that which is seen; it takes no account of that which is not seen.\"\n\n> It is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, or added another book to his library. In short, he would have employed his six francs in some way, which this accident has prevented.\n\nAnd this point was widely accepted as persuasive; or at least, it was accepted by economists.\n\nBut actually, Bastiat's original essay is worded in a bit of an odd way.  Why focus on the fact that when the shopkeeper has spent *six francs* in one place, he can't spend them somewhere else?  If the limiting factor is really money, couldn't we make all of society better off by adding more money?  You would ordinarily expect a healthy economy to be limited by its resources, by the available sand and heat for making glass: if the glazier replaces one window, he isn't replacing another.  Or if somebody works to provide the glazier with more sand and coal than he'd have otherwise had, to make more glass than he otherwise would've, then that's coal which isn't going to the smithy.\n\nOf course what Bastiat really meant is that sending resources to repair a broken window calls away those resources from somewhere else; and this is symbolized by the six francs being spent in one place rather than another.  That's how a modern economy works: when goods flow in one direction, money flows in the other direction.  So Bastiat talks about the change in a flow of francs, as a shorthand for talking about the corresponding change in a flow of goods.\n\nOkay, but what if the economy is in a depression?  What if the glazier was standing idle until the window was broken, and isn't being called away from any other job?  What if there's a ton of coal in an empty lot, waiting for someone to purchase it, and the reason nobody is purchasing it is that nobody seems to have any money?\n\nWell, in this case, it *still* doesn't help to go around breaking windows.  And Bastiat's original wording happens to precisely describe the resulting problem: the shopkeeper will *spend* six francs on the broken window and therefore not *spend* six francs on something else.  The money spent in one place, is then no longer available somewhere else, to animate a flow of goods moving in the opposite direction.\n\nThe only way we can imagine that breaking a window will help this economy, is if the shopkeeper has a buried chest of silver, and when somebody throws a rock through his window, the shopkeeper spends some of this buried silver, and then the shopkeeper *doesn't* try later to top off this chest of buried silver again.  Only in that hypothetical is there actually an additional six francs added to the economy, flowing to an otherwise idle glazier, who trades with a baker that wouldn't bake otherwise, who buys from a farmer who can afford to grow more crops than before.\n\nWould you agree with that statement -- with the paragraph as written above?  Standard economics says it is correct.\n\nBut this has now given us an even *more* astonishing implication:\n\nThis seems to say that we could just *print more money* and make the shopkeeper's town better off.  That's pretty much the same as digging up money from a buried chest and not replacing it, right?\n\n## More money, fewer problems?\n\n\"Now hold on,\" says the alert computer scientist, sitting bolt upright (and not without cause).  \"I know that society conditions us to think of these little rectangular pieces of paper as super valuable, but dollar bills or euro bills or whatever are just *symbols* for the actual goods and services that are actually valuable.  Thinking you can create more goods and services by creating more money is like counting your fingers, getting an answer of 10, erasing the 10 and writing down 11, and thinking you'll end up with 11 fingers.  Only you're *literally* doing that with writing down new numbers in bank accounts, versus the rest of the economy.  Money isn't wealth, it's a claim on wealth, and if you counterfeit $100 in your bank account, you're just making a false claim on wealth that someone else won't get.  Any theory that says you can create more wealth by creating more money, no matter how complicated the argument, will in the end turn out to be missing some row of the array that makes the numbers add up to zero; 'what is seen, and what is not seen', as Bastiat put it.\"\n\nAnd in a *healthy* economy, this would be correct.  But remember, those empty factories and that idle labor is not supposed to exist in the first place.   Is it so impossible that a weird condition that shouldn't exist, could be fixed by a weird tactic that shouldn't work?\n\n\"So what you're saying,\" says the skeptical computer scientist, \"is that the two impossibilities cancel out.  Like the story about the physics student who derived $E = -mc^2,$ and who gets told to next time try to make an even number of mistakes.\"\n\nWell, yes, pretty much.  First, let's consider a more ordinary exception to the rule that creating money can't help--the reason that money exists in the first place.\n\nSuppose that Alice, Bob, and Carol are as usual stuck on a deserted island.  Alice is growing apples, Bob grows bananas, and Carol grows cucumbers.  One day Alice wants a banana, Bob wants a cucumber, and Carol wants an apple; and they all go hungry because Alice doesn't have any cucumbers to trade to Bob for a banana.  Also they don't have computers on their deserted island, so they can't do anything clever like write software to detect cycles in people's available and desired goods.\n\nIn this case the standard solution for this lack of computing power is 'money'.  Creating money to add to this island, where there was no money at all before, actually does make the three people on the island better off.  They can legitimately end up better off by trading with each other, and the money causes more trades to occur than otherwise would.\n\nWhen an economy has idle factories and standing workers, it's in a state where more trades *could* occur, but aren't occurring.  Adding more money to that economy, to animate more trades, isn't far from what happens when we add money to an island that didn't have it.  The glazier spending another six francs dug up from the ground and not replaced later, which then flow to animate a trade with the baker in his mostly empty shop, and keeps circulating from there, can actually cause a larger number of trades to occur and make the economy actually wealthier.\n\nNow I have, indeed, pulled a bit of wool over your eyes with this argument.  The macroeconomic theory is waaaaay more complicated than this, in much the same way modern neural nets are a tad more complicated than just the idea of gradient descent.  But after we're done clipping gradients and initializing orthogonal weights and normalizing batches, in the end deep neural nets are *still* sliding down a loss gradient.  Similarly, it really looks in theory and in historical observation like an economy with idle resources, especially *unemployed workers,* can be made actually wealthier by creating more money.\n\nAnd that is--on the standard theory--why fractional reserve banks blowing up and destroying money and making fewer loans, cause there to be a bunch of unemployed people and fewer jobs and nobody being able to afford anything because none of their customers can afford to buy from them.  In a modern economy, for every flow of goods, there's money flowing the other way; and when you destroy money or slow down its flow, this can reduce the actual number of trades.\n\nTo give an idea of some of the complications we are blatantly skipping over: classical economics says that slowdown should not in fact happen, not to rational actors.  In a rational world, if somebody sets fire to half of the money supply, everyone just halves their prices and life goes on.\n\nThe reason our world is *not* like that ideal world where the prices just go down, is partially that there are outstanding loans denominated in the current currency, and existing contracts denominated in the current currency.  But *most* of the problem--according to the particular economic school I happen to subscribe to--is that people who set prices are *reluctant to lower them* in a way that an economy full of perfectly rational actors wouldn't be.\n\nAnd this is the kind of statement that causes fistfights between economists.\n\nSo there are certain alternate views here.\n\nBut there is indeed wisespread agreement that, for whatever reason, we don't live in the classical world of perfectly rational actors.  Which means that banks blowing up and thereby reducing the flow of money, can reduce the amount of flowing goods instead of prices dropping.  We are pretty sure from observation that this does in fact happen.\n\nAnd then, in that particular case, printing more money can help more trades occur and bring the economy closer to operating at real capacity.  Historical observation also *seems* to bear this out, although the near-impossibility of running real controlled experiments makes it hard to be sure.  The most recent case you might have heard about was in 2013 in the United States, where the \"sequester\" was going to produce a sharp cut in government spending just as the US was starting to recover a little bit, not completely, from the Great Recession.  Some people predicted the economy would tank again; and other people said it would be fine so long as the Federal Reserve created a correspondingly large amount of money, aka **monetary offset.**  And the sequester happened, and the Federal Reserve did in fact print a bunch of money, and pretty much nothing happened to the economy.  Amazing proof, right?\n\nOkay, so that's not a very detailed observation if you're used to getting 127GB of training data any time you feel like it.  But it was in fact an experimental test of two different predictions, and the economists who thought in terms of flowing money were right; and in the end, that's all we have in this life.\n\n## The general glut\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes -- I know some of you hate him, but he was a respected economist and he came up with a clever illustration, so please bear with me -- John Maynard Keynes once came up with a clever illustration of what could possibly cause anything as weird as a recession, and how this could possibly be fixed by anything as weird as printing money.\n\nSuppose that on an island, Alice and Bob and Carol are growing apples and oranges and pomegranites.  Furthermore, as in the Great Depression, it is not yet the case that everyone has enough to eat.\n\nIn this situation, could there be an excess supply or \"glut\" of apples?  Alice and Bob, who both grow apples, could have had such a large apple harvest that people on the island prefer to eat other, scarcer fruits if those are available.  In this case we'd see the relative value of apples, compared to other fruits, dropping.  Maybe 1 apple used to be worth 1 orange and 1 pomegranite, and now somebody would only trade 1 orange or 1 pomegranite for 2 apples.  Alice and Bob would be wise to shift more of their effort to growing oranges and pomegranites, going forward.\n\nWe could indeed call this a \"glut\" of apples, which (so long as people don't have *all* the food they want) describes a *relative* excess of supply of apples, compared to the supply/demand balance of other fruits.  To say that apples are now cheaper in terms of oranges, is equally to say that oranges have become more expensive in terms of apples.\n\nBut is it possible to have a glut of *every kind of fruit at once?*  While Alice and Bob and Carol would still individually prefer to eat more, that is?  How could that be (asked Keynes)?  You can't have *each* fruit being ultra-cheap as denominated in all the other fruits.  Then what are we to think of a supposed situation in which Alice and Bob and Carol are still not full, but they are cutting back on growing apples *and* oranges *and* pomegranites, because they have too much of all of them?\n\nHow is it possible for a whole economy to be suffering from a problem of \"excess supply\" where factories in general are going idle?\n\nAnd the answer (said Keynes) is that the only way this \"general glut\" can happen is if there is some additional, invisible good that people are demanding more than apples and oranges *and* pomegranites; so that the values of apples and oranges *and* pomegranites are all falling relative to the value of this invisible good.  And the way that this can happen in real life (said Keynes) is if Alice and Bob and Carol have invented a fourth, invisible good called money.\n\nThat is: it's the weird symbolic nature of money as an artificial good, that allows recessions and Depressions to happen in the first place.  Which is why the books can in fact balance, when we try to fix a recession by creating more money.\n\nI haven't heard the phrase \"general glut\" used outside of textbooks, but it's still a neat illustration.\n\n## Aggregate demand and monetary stimulus\n\nWhen economists talk about this sort of thing, they've been known to use the phrase \"**aggregate demand**\".\n\nActual human wants are, if not infinite, then certainly a lot higher than the total amount of stuff produced by the world economy!  We don't all have mansions, at least not yet.  So what \"aggregate demand\" really means is more like \"aggregate purchasing power\", which in turn means \"total amount of flowing money trying to buy all the goods\".  \n\nThe standard economic view can then be stated compactly: when the financial system blows up and a recession occurs and people get unemployed and factories go empty, what's happening is an \"**aggregate demand deficit**\"; in other words, there isn't enough purchasing power to buy all the stuff the economy could supply.\n\nOne reason this happens is because the exploding banks (or, nowadays, banks that get bailed out but are less enthusiastic about making more loans afterwards) reduce the \"**money supply**\" - one reason there's less money flowing and fewer corresponding trades, is because there's less actual money.\n\nAnother reason aggregate demand decreases, is that people also want to *hold on* to more money during a depression or a recession.  This decreases **monetary velocity.**\n\nWhen all this is starting to go wrong inside a country, conventional economics says that the central bank ought to immediately swing into action and create more money, aka \"**monetary stimulus**\".  (Or rather, the central bank is supposed to create money and use it to buy government bonds or something, and then hold onto the bonds.  Later on, when monetary velocity picks up, the central bank sells the bonds and destroys the money it previously created, to avoid creating too much inflation.  They're supposed to do \"**temporary monetary stimulus**\" in order to regularize the ongoing flow of all money.)\n\nIf the Federal Reserve thinks it *can't* create enough money, then it is alleged that the government can sell treasury bonds for money, spend the resulting money, and then people still have bonds which satisfy some of the same desire to hold assets.  This is \"**fiscal stimulus**\" and whether it is ever a good idea to do this is another one of those questions that cause economists to get into fistfights.  (I personally happen to side with the school that goes around saying, \"What do you mean, the central bank *can't create enough money* to stabilize the aggregate flow of currency and the number of trades occurring?  Did you run out of ones and zeroes?\")\n\nIt's possible that there's some way to solve this problem without central banks, yes, I know, 13% of you are right this minute trying to figure out some way to do it using a blockchain.  But right now countries do have central banks; and taking that as a fact at least for now, that's what conventional economic theory says central banks ought to do.\n\nAll of this is, in net, one reason why when people start worrying about technological unemployment due to AI advances, one of the obvious other things that you need to do on the side of whatever else you're doing -- really *really* need to do, actually, all this has a *huge* impact on the economy -- is worry about making sure that there is, in national economies as a whole, *enough money for people to buy things.*\n\nIt is in fact very possible for the economy to end up in a state where most people feel poor, and can't afford to buy things from each other, and go around being sad and out of work, such that you could in fact cause everyone to perk up and trade with each other and be happy again *by letting everyone have more money.*  (Simultaneously!  Not just moving money around as happens with basic income.)  If everyone thinks they're poor and can't afford to work for each other, despite there being an adequate supply of factories and things people want, you can sometimes fix the problem by, in effect, letting everyone just be rich instead.  If you saw lots of people standing around doing nothing after advances in automation, that would be the *first* thing you tried.\n\nIt's not agreed among economists which countries are presently suffering from too little aggregate demand, and working under capacity.  The economists in my preferred school suspect that it is presently happening inside the European Union due to the European Central Bank being run by lunatics.  Most economists think the United States is *not* currently bounded by an aggregate demand deficit, or running far under capacity.  I myself feel a bit unsure about that; sometimes it really seems like we could all be much happier if we all just simultaneously decided to be 10% richer.  Or that, say, Arizona, would actually benefit a *lot* from having its own currency to use on the side, until everyone there was working for everyone else.  But I haven't really paid enough attention to this area, and you probably shouldn't listen to me.\n\nI'm going to temporarily stop going on about this because there's other economic concepts I want to run through and I don't want to risk boring you about that; but I'm going to pick this up in a later section about \"NGDP level targeting.\"  For now, I just want to note that, compared to reforming labor markets, it can actually be a lot simpler to print more ones and zeroes in the central bank, and central banks are not completely unwilling to hear about it.  It's arguably an excellent choice for what we should try to fix *first.*\n\n# Gently sloping supply curves, and skyrocketing prices\n\nBy now you might be picking up a general sense of a not-that-bad post-automation state which seems like *in theory* it shouldn't be that hard to achieve.  *If* things are happening in a very reasonable way, the way that simplified economics theories talk about before they start getting complicated.\n\nYou could look further ahead than I think we're actually going to get -- not because I don't think AI can get that far, quite the opposite really, but still -- and imagine a world where human beings... are still trading with each other.\n\nA world where at least it doesn't happen, that Alice knows how to grow food, and Bob knows how to build houses, and they're both going around cold and hungry because agriculture and house-building have been automated.\n\nYou can imagine a world where, okay, some of the dignity has been lost, and some of the remaining jobs aren't as awesome as when people were forging refrigerators out of raw steel with their bare hands.  But people still want things and other people still do them.\n\nA world where we at least haven't just wantonly *defined* ourselves into poverty, where, okay, robots exist, but people also have money in their bank accounts.\n\nA world where people have as at least as much dignity as they'd have in 1960.  Because logically, any given group could always draw a line around themselves and go back to 1960s technology.  And if that group then *removes* the line, starts trading with others, and adds more technology, life should only get better for them from there, because of Ricardo's Law of Comparative Advantage.  Right?\n\nThere are a number of obvious problems that could completely blow up this scenario, and why modern life for a heck of a lot of people in fact looks nothing like this.\n\nIn particular, if there's any good X that people *really* need, and that stays extremely expensive in the face of automation.  Then it doesn't matter of a region tries to print its own currency to maintain trade, people still end up being poor; because it takes months and months of babysitting to afford one unit of good X.\n\nA good like, say, *housing, health care,* or *college,* all of which have been skyrocketing in price seemingly without limit over the last few decades.\n\nFor an overview of the enormous problem, I would recommend Slate Star's \"[Considerations on Cost Disease](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/)\".  For example, it turns out that the United States spends around $4000 per citizen on Medicaid and Medicare and insurance subsidies, and that $4000 is around what other countries pay for *universal* coverage; it's not that the United States is unwilling to pay for universal coverage, but that somehow healthcare costs far more in the United States (without any discernibly improved medical outcomes, of course).\n\nYou can find various graphs showing that all of the increased productivity over the last 20 years has been sucked up by increasing housing prices.  Or that all of the missing wages, as productivity rises and wages stay flat, can be accounted for by the cost of health care.  I can't recall seeing a graph like that for college costs and student debt, but it sure ain't cheap.  If all of those graphs are true simultaneously, and they are, well, you can see why people might be feeling increasingly impoverished even if their nominal wages in dollars are theoretically flat.\n\nAnd if things like that went on happening while a hypothetical tidal wave of automation was crashing in... then that would certainly smash any utopian vision of people continuing to trade with each other while all the real prices dropped.\n\nThere are various aspects of this that economists will still get into fistfights over, so I can't just hand you a standard analysis.  But if I look for standard economics concepts that are definitely *relevant* to parsing the problem, and that have some standardly predicted consequences that go mysteriously missing from political conversations...\n\n## Supply and demand functions\n\nSupply and demand are always equal.\n\nIf we look at all the loaves of bread sold in a city on Monday, then, on that Monday, the number of loaves of bread sold, and the number of loaves bought, are equal to one another.  Every time a loaf of bread is sold, there's one person selling the loaf and one person buying a loaf.\n\nImagining supply not equaling demand is like imagining a collection of nonoverlapping line segments with an odd number of endpoints.\n\nOr that's how economists technically define the words \"supply\" and \"demand\", anyway.  So what use is such a merely tautologous equation?\n\nWell, it lets economists talk about **supply curves** and **demand curves,** which go as a function of prices.  Or to be snootier, **supply functions** and **demand functions.**  The point at which the two curves *meet* - since *supply and demand are always equal* - tells us the price level.\n\nBut if supply equals demand by definition, then how would we talk about the old days of the Soviet Union, where there were 1000 people who wanted toilet paper and only 400 rolls of toilet paper?  And it was illegal for the store to raise the set price of toilet paper?  In this case, didn't demand just directly exceed supply?\n\nWhat one actually sees in a Soviet supermarket is a long line of people waiting outside before the store opens, trying to get to the toilet paper before it's gone.  An economist would regard the *time spent in line* as part of the 'price' of a roll of toilet paper.  No matter how the demand curve slopes--no matter how much people want toilet paper--the time required to stand in line will increase until 600 people give up and go home.  And then the monetary price of the toilet paper, *plus* the time required to stand in line, is the \"price\" at which the demand function meets the supply function.\n\nThis wasn't good for the Soviet Union because the time spent in line was burned, destroyed, in a way that produced nothing.  When the price is allowed to go up, under capitalism, the successful buyers may indeed spend more money; but just passing that money around doesn't destroy wealth the way that standing in line destroys time.  The flip side is that everyone ultimately has an equal supply of time and not everyone has an equal supply of money; poorer people *can* sometimes benefit relative to non-poor people when part of a good is repriced in time rather than money.  (Naturally, sufficiently rich people just hire someone else to stand in line.)\n\nIf you set up a cart selling $20 bills for $1 each, a line will form in front of the cart and extend until it's long enough to burn $18.99 worth of the time of people who could otherwise earn the least amount of money per hour.  You can't *actually* sell $20 bills, to anyone who wants them, at a price of $1, and have that be the real, full price.\n\nA similar dynamic plays out every year when the organizers of Burning Man once again try to defy the laws of logic as well as capitalism in order to sell 70,000 tickets at a fixed price of $500, with resale at higher prices resulting in your tickets being pulled at the last minute if Burning Man finds out about it... to way more than 70,000 people willing to pay significantly more than $500.  (I've heard it suggested that, in this case, the real \"price\" is pulling on your social connections in order to obtain Burning Man tickets for a nominal price of $500, via trading favors with people who were savvy enough to sign up for the sales lottery.  Thus selecting socially savvy people to attend Burning Man.)\n\n## When subsidy is futile and will be assimilated\n\nImagine a city under siege, where there are only 3,000 loaves of bread to be had, and each loaf is selling for 2 golden crowns.  Can the governor of the city ease the plight of the people by ordering the treasury to pay 1 golden crown for loaf?  The people will still be hungry -- there's still only so much bread to go around -- but perhaps at least their *financial* pain can be eased?\n\nNo, in fact.  The price of the 3,000 loaves of bread rises until all but 3,000 people drop out of the market for purchasing it.  If there are 3,000 people willing to pay 2 golden crowns for a loaf of bread, and the governor steps in and says the city will pay 1 golden crown per loaf of the price, then there will be 3,000 people willing to pay 2 golden crowns plus 1 golden crown subsidy.  The price of each loaf rises to 3 crowns, and the 3,000 people buying it are 2 golden crowns out of pocket, the same as before.\n\nIn economitalk, we'd say that the supply was **inflexible,** in other words, the supply curve was horizontal with respect to price; no matter how much more people paid (the x axis), the supply of bread stayed the same (the y axis).  The demand curve does slope, in this example; it slopes downward with increasing price, until it crosses the flat supply curve at a price point of 2 golden crowns.\n\nIf the governor then adds a subsidy of 1 golden crown to each purchase of bread, we are in effect *shifting the demand curve to the right* along the x-axis - the demand for bread at 2 golden crowns, is now the higher demand level we would have previously seen at a price of 1 golden crown.  We have had a change of variables: Demand(x') = Demand(x - 1 crown).  Since the supply curve is flat, this just means that the two curves meet at a price' which is 1 golden crown greater than the old price.\n\nIn other words:  It doesn't help any buyers to try to subsidize a good in inflexible supply.  The only way subsidies can *possibly* help buyers *at all,* is if increasing the price of the good causes more of the good to exist.\n\n## Skyrocketing prices\n\nA price skyrockets when...\n\n(drum roll)\n\n...a gently sloping demand curve meets a gently sloping supply curve.\n\nIf the demand curve slopes sharply downward, the price can't increase very far, because this describes a state of affairs where, as the price of the good increases, lots of people *rapidly* become unwilling to pay and drop out of the market before the price has moved very far.\n\nIf the supply curve slopes sharply upward, the price can't increase very far.  As the price goes up, the market is rapidly flooded with more sellers seeking to produce the good.\n\nSo if the city of San Francisco refuses to build more than a handful of apartments, and a large number of people in search of jobs *really* want to live in San Francisco and do *not* want to be driven out even as prices go up... we shall see prices skyrocket; until, however reluctantly, the least wealthy people among the excess demanders are driven out of the Bay Area.\n\n\"I already knew that,\" you say.  Okay, but now consider health care and college.\n\nIn the United States there are, if I recall correctly, only 350 people allowed to become orthodontists every year.\n\nFor as long as that stays true--and we are talking about a deeply entrenched system here--it can accomplish literally nothing to try to subsidize orthodontics.  You cannot cause more poor children to have braces by having the government offer to pay for their orthodontia.  Orthodontic colleges have decided to graduate 350 orthodontists per year and turn down all other applicants, and those 350 people can only put braces on a limited number of patients.  No amount of shuffling money around or tweaking insurance regulations can allow *more* people to have braces than that.\n\nOnce upon a time, the US government passed a GI bill and, in fact, a lot more people went to college.  So there must have been more colleges springing up, or existing colleges must have expanded to serve more students.  That's the only possible way that a lot more people could have ended up going to college.\n\nLater, it seemed like there still weren't enough people going to college.  So the US government offered to subsidize loan insurance in order to allow more students to get loans to pay for college.  And now US college prices have skyrocketed and people are leaving college with a crippling, immiserating load of student debt.\n\nSo: by the second time around, there was some kind of increased barrier or difficulty to starting a new college, or at least starting the kind of college that anyone actually wanted to go to.  We also infer that people *really really* wanted to go to college, and moreover, go to a non-horrible college with a reputation, instead of a new for-profit college that nobody had heard about.  And that existing reputable colleges were unwilling or unable to expand.  Otherwise the price couldn't have gone up.\n\nYou can't subsidize housing unless higher housing prices can cause there to be more housing.  You can't subsizide college unless higher tuitions can cause new (desirable) colleges to spring up or old colleges to expand.  There's literally nothing you can do to cause more people to have more healthcare by moving around insurance premiums, unless the resulting higher prices are causing more doctors and more hospitals to exist.\n\nThis isn't a simple issue, obviously.  The main oddity I'd like to observe is this: that politicians only ever talk about demand and prices, who gets to purchase and how much they pay, and they usually discuss supply not at all.\n\n## Supply and demand in politics.\n\nIf you were around for the 2008 Presidential election in the US, there was this lovely case where some gasoline refineries had broken down, and thus the US was experiencing a gasoline shortage with sharply rising prices.  And there was a proposal to temporarily repeal some gasoline taxes...\n\n...which would have been a *pure gift* to gasoline refineries.  The total supply of gasoline was price-unresponsive; it couldn't go up until refineries were built or repaired.  It was pretty much the city under seige in which you got 3000 loaves of bread per day, period.\n\nAnd so pretty much every academic economist in the United States, Republican and Democrat alike, was saying, \"This will not change prices at the pump.  It won't even cause gas stations to make more money.  Literally the only people who benefit from shifting this demand curve to the right are the owners of gasoline refineries.\"\n\nJohn McCain was in favor of temporarily lifting the tax.  Hillary Clinton was in favor of lifting the tax.  In an extraordinary moment that stunned all of us who knew economics, Barack Obama came out *against* lifting the tax.\n\nOnly Obama couldn't actually say outright:  \"McCain and Clinton certainly know as well as I do why this measure would be futile, but they think most of the electorate is too stupid to understand the most elementary possible economic points that involve literally any abstraction whatsoever; and therefore McCain and Clinton don't dare publicly oppose decreased gas taxes while everyone is angry about gas prices.\"\n\nI don't know if it's true that it will always be impossible to talk about the limited number of orthodontists graduated when talking about subsidizing braces; but if almost all the politicians *believe* that voters won't understand and will get angry, it amounts to the same outcome, whether voters would actually get angry or not.\n\nI haven't the tiniest idea about how to solve this problem.  Maybe you do.\n\nAnyway, the point is, the *cost disease* across housing, education, and above all, medicine, is a big darned problem that can smash an otherwise pleasant outcome where everything gets cheaper as a result of automation and this causes people not to become effectively poor.  I have no idea how you can solve this, but you *can't* solve it by advocating for more government subsidies or trying to move existing subsidies around.  To make costs come down again, you need to either (a) make people stop wanting surgeons, bachelors' degrees, and bedrooms; or (b) you need to somehow make more of those things exist, in a world where supply is not already increasing just because the price is skyrocketing.",
