      "text": "This is a FAQ aimed at a very rapid introduction to key standard economic concepts to professionals in AI and machine learning who have become concerned with the potential economic impacts of their work, or who want to participate in conversations about the economic impact of present and future Artificial Intelligence.\n\nYou will in fact need a strong intuitive understanding of \"comparative advantage\", and several other key concepts, to talk sensibly about a declining labor force participation rate and what ought to be done about it.  Just like you yourself might perhaps feel a bit frustrated when trying to discuss which professions are liable to be automated in the near future, with somebody who doesn't understand the notion of gradient descent and why some human jobs have loss functions that are harder to measure and differentiate.  It's not that the concepts are mathematically hard in an absolute sense, it's that you really do need to be parsing the world using those basic concepts.  I won't belabor this point any further.\n\nWithout further ado, here's a quick list of some concepts that this particular author thinks are important:\n\n- **Comparative advantage** says that even if Alice is less efficient (less productive) at all of her tasks than is Bob, Alice and Bob still both benefit from being able to trade with one another.\n - If Alice is *relatively* twice as good at growing apples than she is at growing oranges, and Bob is relatively twice as good at growing oranges than growing apples, Alice and Bob can both benefit by trading her apples for his oranges, even if Bob can grow 10 times as many apples per unit of labor than Alice.\n- The **lump of labour fallacy** is the standard term for the (appealing but incorrect) reasoning which says that if you automate away 95% of the jobs, only 5% of the people remain employed.\n - Humanity did in fact automate away 95% of all labor during the industrial revolution - 98% of the population used to be farmers, and now it's 3% - and yet more than 5% of the people still have jobs.\n - The standard explanation for why we aren't all already unemployed revolves around **complementary inputs:** if each sausage-in-a-bun requires 1 sausage and 1 bun, and it previously took 20 units of labor to make 10 sausages and 10 units of labor to make 10 sausage buns, and then sausage-making productivity doubles, the classically predicted new equilibrium is 15 sausages in 15 buns.\n - Maybe this is, in fact, not what is happening right now.  But it's definitely what happened during most of human history, and you need to intuitively understand the background classical prediction in order to *not* just try to reinterpret the present situation through the eyes of the lump of labour fallacy.\n- The **broken window fallacy** is the standard term for the (appealing but incorrect) reasoning which says that if you heave a rock through somebody's window, they have to pay the glazier to repair the window, and the glazier buys bread from the baker, and so production thrives and everybody is better off.\n - The key to understanding *why* this is a fallacy will revolve around the concept of **aggregate demand**.  Under normal conditions the economy should be bounded by the available supply of glass and similar goods, and destroying goods in one place diverts them from somewhere else.  Modern economies *can* get into wedged states where glaziers are sitting idle; and the economy is then bounded by a different quantity, the amount of flowing money available to animate trades.  But heaving a rock through a window doesn't increase this quantity either.\n- When a good has a relatively low-sloped **supply curve** (curve for supply versus price), subsidizing that good will tend to increase its price much more than the amount of that good.\n - If you make it easier for people to take out loans to go to universities, but it's not very easy to build lots of new universities, the result is that people end up with a lot of student loan debt.\n- \"Inequality\" in a bad sense usually results from **rent extraction.**  Under some conditions, equilibrium extractible rents sometimes only go up when people's incomes would otherwise rise.\n - Reading articles written by actual poor people in the US gives the strong impression that one's top priority for helping them ought to be outlawing towing fees.\n - This is one potential thing that might go wrong with the basic income.  It might possibly just cause the Ferguson Police Department to issue more tickets, unless you fix the Ferguson Police Department first.\n - Excessive intellectual property protection can also cause excess concentration of rents.\n - Economies of scale in dealing with regulators -- being able to afford lawyers -- can effectively protect big companies from competition and enable them to extract monopoly rents.\n- **Labor market flexibility** (aka the ability of people to move around and match up with available jobs) is a critical factor in employment.  This can be hindered by e.g. restrictions on building more housing in cities with high labor demand.\n - We could equally view this as due to major employers continuing to situate new jobs in the cities with already-skyrocketing housing prices.  (One observes that, often, these housing costs are relatively far less burdensome on the high-level decision makers who decide where to put the company.)\n- **Effective marginal tax rates** are how much benefit accrues to somebody who earns 1 more dollar at their current wage level.  Not just due to income taxes and payroll taxes, but also due to phasing-out of benefits, it's possible for somebody who earns +$1 to be effectively +$0.20 better off, or even for this number to go negative.\n - Current estimates of effective marginal tax rates in low income brackets are usually in the range of 70% and on many 'cliffs' higher than 100%.\n- Alternatives to minimum wage include **wage subsidies.**\n - We can consider the minimum wage as a subsidy on wages paid for by a marginal tax on employers who hire people at less than the minimum wage.  If society thinks this subsidy is a good idea, it should almost certainly not be paid for by those particular employers.\n- Alternatives to labor taxes include **land value tax** and **consumption taxes.**\n - If you tax labor, you'll discourage labor.  Taxing the implicit rents on land doesn't cause there to be less land, so it's a less distortive tax.\n- **Sticky prices** of labor, especially **downward sticky** wages, cause small amounts of deflation to do far more damage to economies than small amounts of deflation.\n - This is one reason why modern economics suggests trying to stabilize an economy at 2% inflation rather than 0% inflation; small amounts of inflation help prices adjust to new realities over time.\n - There's an up-and-coming view, not yet fully adopted, which rephrases the view as being about the total amount of flowing money, and says that people lose their jobs when there isn't enough flowing money to pay their wages.  This view suggests that the best help monetary policy can give to employment is **targeting a price level** of **per-capita NGDP.**\n\nMany readers will also have ideas about:\n\n- Regulatory burdens on employers decreasing employment.\n- \"Regulatory capture\" by large corporations influencing regulators to make it harder for new entrants to compete with them.\n- Regulatory compliance costs generally decreasing economic productivity.\n\nThere is not universal agreement on how large these problems are, or whether they should be top priorities.  But standard economics does not regard these ideas as *naive,* so I won't discuss them any further in this FAQ.  My purpose here is to introduce relatively more technical concepts, that are more likely to be new to the reader, and that refute views widely regarded by professional economists as being misguided on technical grounds.\n\nThis document is currently incomplete, and the Table of Contents below shows what is currently covered.\n\n[toc:]\n\n# Comparative advantage, and the mercantilist fallacy\n\n**Ricardo's Law of Comparative Advantage** says that parties (individuals, groups, countries) can both benefit from trading with each other, even when one party has an **absolute advantage** over the other in every factor of production.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- Alice can produce 20 apples per unit of labor, and 10 oranges per unit of labor.\n- Bob can produce 50 apples per unit of labor, and 100 oranges per unit of labor.\n- Alice and Bob both have 10 units of labor to use.\n\nIf Alice wants an equal number of apples and oranges, she's better off producing 200 apples with all of her labor, and then trading 100 of the apples to Bob for 100 oranges.\n\nBob in turn is better off producing 100 oranges with 1 unit of labor, and trading them to Alice for 100 apples, than Bob would be if he used 2 units of labor to produce 100 apples directly.\n\nEconomists usually regard this idea as refuting some widespread intuitions about **mercantilism,** which says that countries are better off the more they sell to other countries, and worse off the more they buy from other countries.\n\nAnother possibly-not-intuitive consequence of comparative advantage is that, except for *sticky prices* (see below), the exchange rates on a country's currency have little long-run effect on its trade.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- Germany buys 100,000 dollars from the US for 100,000 euros;\n- Germany then uses these 100,000 dollars to buy 100 air conditioners from the US;\n- People in the US use their 100,000 euros to buy 10 cars from Germany.\n\nOne day the European Central Bank decides to print enough new euros to halve the value of the currency.  Then:\n\n- People in Germany buy 100,000 dollars from people in the US, using 200,000 euros.\n- People in Germany buy 100 air conditioners from the US for $1000 each.\n- People in the US buy 10 cars from Germany, each of which now costs 20,000 euros.\n\nRicardo's Law thus suggests that we can view the US as shipping 100 air conditioners to Germany in exchange for 10 cars, with the currency exchange rates being something of an epiphenomenon.  (In practice this is modified by \"sticky prices\" in that some people already own euros or dollars, or bonds denominated in euros or dollars, and there are existing sales contracts that fix prices for a term.  But effects like that tend to wash out over the longer run.)\n\nThe concept of comparative advantage is important for discussing technological unemployment because it conveys the general idea that when we draw a line around a group or region, like \"{Alice, Bob, and Carol}\" or \"Wisconsin\", this collective entity is not harmed by being able to trade with someone else who is more productive than them.  (To say nothing of getting their *own* advanced technology.)\n\nThis isn't to say that technological advances can never hurt Wisconsin's economy.  Maybe Wisconsin is trading cheese to Ohio in exchange for coal.  One day, Michigan becomes much more efficient than Wisconsin at producing cheese, causing Ohio to start trading with Michigan instead.  This can hurt Wisconsin's economy, quite a lot in fact.\n\nThe conclusion from Ricardo's Law is rather that Wisconsin can't be harmed by the fact of Wisconsin *itself* being allowed to trade with Michigan.  What hurts Wisconsin in the above scenario is that *Ohio* is allowed to trade with Michigan.  Wisconsin can only make itself even worse off by choosing to cut off its own trade with Michigan.\n\nIf Wisconsin closes its borders and tries to get along in its own little world that doesn't include those awful new cheese-making machines, Ricardo's Law says that Wisconsin as a whole *should* become worse-off thereby.  If this stops being true, then some unusual phenomenon must be at work, one that violates the broad axioms under which Ricardo's Law is a theorem.\n\nAn intuition I'll be trying to pump throughout this FAQ is that the state of affairs over most of human history, in which technological automation made most people better off without causing them to be permanently unemployed, is a very normal state of affairs from the standpoint of economic theory.  If we're currently looking at lasting unemployment caused by automation, this is a *surprising* state of affairs.\n\nAnd:  Even if something has changed and something weird is going on, the reason for it won't be that Ricardo's Law suddenly stopped being a theorem.  Whatever the truth turns out to be, Ricardo's Law will still be a relatively better lens than mercantilism through which to understand it.\n\n# Complementary inputs, and the lump of labour fallacy\n\nBroadly speaking, the \"**lump of labour fallacy**\" is reasoning as if there's a limited amount of work to be done in the world, and a limited number of jobs to go around, and every time one of those jobs is automated away, one more person ends up unemployed.\n\nSuppose that:\n\n- People like to eat sausages in buns.\n- Each sausage-in-a-bun requires 1 sausage and 1 bun as an input, and a trivial amount of labor to assemble.\n- At present, it requires 1 unit of labor to make a bun, and 2 units of labor to make a sausage.\n- The resulting equilibrium involves 10 sausages-in-a-bun being manufactured by 30 people expending 30 units of labor.\n\nSo then the critical question becomes: if we invent a new kind of sausage-making machine that doubles productivity and makes it possible to produce 2 sausages using 2 units of labor, do we...\n\n- End up with 10-sausages-in-a-bun produced by 20 people, and 10 unemployed former sausage makers?\n- End up with 15-sausages-in-a-bun produced by 30 people?\n\nEnding up in the second equilibrium, maybe not right away, is widely regarded as the core idea behind how we could start with a world where 98% of the population were farmers, improving agricultural productivity by a factor of 100 between then and now, and end up with a world in which 3% of the people are farmers and the other 95% of the population are *not* unemployed.\n\nOne way of looking at this is that, over the course of human history so far, *everything* has behaved like it is complementary.  When agricultural productivity skyrocketed, a bunch of people went into making shoes and clothes and tables and houses.  The end result was that more people had food, more people had more nice clothes and furniture, and *not* that most of the population ended up unemployed.  The \"food\" input to a human became cheaper, and labor went into making more of the \"clothes\" and \"furniture\" inputs to humans.  Then again later, when manufacturing productivity skyrocketed, more people went into services.\n\nNow it could be that this phenomenon is now breaking down for any number of possible reasons.  But among those reasons, it seems relatively implausible that we have reached *the end of demand* and that all the people now have enough of every kind of good and service that they want.  There are way too many poor and unhappy people still in the world for that to be true!\n\nOkay, so we haven't reached the end of human wants.  But maybe some people in the modern world can no longer produce *anything* that other people want...?\n\nI'd like to encourage you to regard this idea with some surprise.  Especially the notion that this \"unnecessariat\" exists today, before we can reliably build a robot that puts away the dishes from a dishwasher without breaking them.  AI is making progress, but we haven't exactly reached par-human perception and motor skills, yet.  Are there really people in the world who can do *nothing* that *anybody* else with money wants?\n\nHeck, why can't those people trade with each other?  Why can't people in this supposed unnecessariat at least help each other, and get their own economy going, even if nobody else wants to trade with them?  And doesn't Ricardo's Law say that this state of affairs ought to provide a floor on the group's minimum economic activity, since in theory the group can only benefit further by trading with the outside world...?\n\nWhy *isn't* it an economic theorem that there's never any unemployment?\n\nI would encourage you to stare at this argument and try to feel surprised that unemployment exists.  It's not that theorems get to overrule reality; if a valid theorem fails to describe reality, that just says one of the axioms must be empirically false.  But we do know that *more* must be going on in the existence of unemployment, than there being a limited lump of jobs and not enough jobs for all the people.\n\n- If you are a neoliberal, you are likely to think about minimum wages, payroll taxes, occupational licensing, and regulatory burdens.  If the state imposes a minimum cost and minimum danger on hiring someone, people may not be able to produce anything that is worth the price and risk to their employer.\n- If you are Tyler Cowen, you will worry that some people in the labor pool are actively destructive; that lawsuits have made it harder for employers to use word-of-mouth to distinguish destructive people; and that people who have been unemployed for a while, end up in a global pool of people who on *average* produce \"zero marginal product\".\n- If you are of a more leftist persuasion, you may worry that the billionaires are running out of real wants, and that the people who *do* want things don't have enough money to buy them.\n- If you are a Georgist, you are liable to observe that \"unemployed\" people can't build houses for each other and can't farm food for each other, because the state has decided that these people own zero land; so they aren't allowed to get started anywhere.\n\nAnd so on.  There are more than enough possible hypotheses to explain why unemployment can possibly exist.  Still, it's worth noting that there was *less* lasting unemployment in, say, 1850.  What changed between then and now... could be all the regulations saying you can't just go build somebody a house.  Or it could be increased inequality.  Or it could be housing prices preventing people from moving to California where there are jobs.\n\nBut it's relatively much stranger to postulate that the *only* problem is that we're running out of jobs in the global lump of labor as AI advances eat away at the lump.\n\nIt could indeed be that existing AI, and to a much larger degree, ordinary computer programming, has gone a long way towards devaluing many jobs that can be done without a college degree.\n\nLabor force participation is in fact dropping under current conditions, whatever those are.  It's possible and maybe probable that, all else being equal, AI conquering more perceptual and motor tasks will make more people permanently unemployed.\n\nIt's reasonable for people in AI to feel concerned about this and want to make things better.\n\nBut it's unlikely that the issue is the end of human want, or the running-out of the lump of labor.  The problem may not be that some people have *intrinsically* nothing left to contribute to any remaining human want; but rather, that the modern world has put obstacles in the way of people being allowed to contribute.\n\nRegardless:  However you look at the situation, and whatever solution you propose, please don't talk about AI or trade or automation \"destroying jobs.\"  This will cause any economists listening to scream in silent horror that they cannot give voice.\n\n# The broken window fallacy, and aggregate demand\n\n## Surprisingly, recessions exist\n\nIn theory, when we double the productivity of sausage-makers, we should get 15 sausages-in-buns instead of 10.  We should not get 10 unemployed sausage-makers; or, if we temporarily get 10 unemployed sausage-makers, that state of affairs shouldn't last longer than it takes sausage-makers to become willing to look for work at the booming bun factories with HELP WANTED signs plastered all over their windows.\n\nAnd yet there seem to be these occasions, like the \"Great Depression\" or the \"Great Recession\", when there are silent factories and people standing idle, or the modern equivalent.  The unemployed sausage-makers are willing to look for new jobs, but there aren't tons of HELP WANTED signs to let them get started on retraining.  The bun factories are actually making fewer buns, because now the unemployed sausage-makers aren't buying sausages-in-a-bun anymore.\n\nOne will observe, however, that these historical occasions seem to come on suddenly, and *not* due to sudden brilliant inventions causing a huge jump in productivity.  They happen at around the same time that there's trouble in the financial system--banks blowing up.\n\nFurthermore, the number of idle factories and amount of idle labor seems to be far in excess of what could reasonably be accounted for by sausage-makers needing to change jobs.  And even people with what might seem like very useful skills, can't find anywhere to put them to use.  None of the previous reasons we've considered, for why unemployment could possibly exist, seem to apply to how *that* much unemployment could exist in the Great Depression.  And then a decade later all those people had jobs again, too; so it wasn't something intrinsic to the people or the jobs that caused them to be unemployed for so long.\n\nThat is weird and astonishing!  If your brain doesn't currently think that is weird and astonishing, please try at least briefly to get yourself into the state of mind where it is.\n\n## The broken window fallacy\n\nAs my entry point into explaining this astonishing paradox, I'm going to take an unusual angle and start with the **broken window fallacy.**\n\nThe broken window fallacy was originally pointed out in 1850 by Frederic Bastiat, in a now-famous essay, \"[That Which Is Seen, And That Which Is Not Seen](http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html)\"  Bastiat begins with the parable of a child who has accidentally thrown a rock through somebody's window:\n\n> Have you ever witnessed the anger of the good shopkeeper, when his careless son happened to break a square of glass? If you have been present at such a scene, you will most assuredly bear witness to the fact, that every one of the spectators, were there even thirty of them, by common consent apparently, offered the unfortunate owner this invariable consolation — \"It is an ill wind that blows nobody good. Everybody must live, and what would become of the glaziers if panes of glass were never broken?\"\n\nAnd doesn't the glazier, in turn, spend money at the baker, and the shoemaker, and the baker and shoemaker spend money at the mill and tannery?  Doesn't all of society end up benefiting from this broken window?\n\n> Now, this form of condolence contains an entire theory, which it will be well to show up in this simple case, seeing that it is precisely the same as that which, unhappily, regulates the greater part of our economical institutions.\n>\n> Suppose it cost six francs to repair the damage, and you say that the accident brings six francs to the glazier's trade — that it encourages that trade to the amount of six francs — I grant it; I have not a word to say against it; you reason justly. The glazier comes, performs his task, receives his six francs, rubs his hands, and, in his heart, blesses the careless child. All this is that which is seen.\n>\n> But if, on the other hand, you come to the conclusion, as is too often the case, that it is a good thing to break windows, that it causes money to circulate, and that the encouragement of industry in general will be the result of it, you will oblige me to call out, \"Stop there! your theory is confined to that which is seen; it takes no account of that which is not seen.\"\n>\n> It is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, or added another book to his library. In short, he would have employed his six francs in some way, which this accident has prevented.\n\nBastiat's point was widely accepted as persuasive; or at least, it was accepted by economists.\n\nLet us nonetheless notice that Bastiat's original essay is worded in a bit of an odd way.  Why focus on the fact that when the shopkeeper has spent six francs in one place, he therefore can't spend six francs somewhere else?  If the limiting factor is just money, couldn't we make all of society better off by adding more money?\n\nYou would ordinarily expect a healthy economy to be limited by its resources, by the available sand and heat for making glass.  If the glazier replaces one window, he isn't replacing another.  Or if some other seller provides the glazier with more sand and coal, to make more glass than he otherwise would've, then that's coal which isn't going to the smithy.\n\nOf course what Bastiat really meant is that sending resources to repair a broken window calls away those resources from somewhere else.  This is *symbolized* by the six francs being spent in one place rather than another.\n\nThat's how a market economy works, after all: when goods flow in one direction, money flows in the other direction.  Six francs flow from the shopkeeper to the glazier; a glass window travels in the opposite direction.\n\nSo Bastiat talks about a change in a flow of francs, as a shorthand for talking about what really matters, a corresponding change in the opposite flow of goods.\n\nNow ask:  What if the economy is, somehow, Greatly Depressed?  What if the glazier was standing idle until the window was broken, and isn't being called away from any other job?  What if there's a ton of coal in an empty lot, waiting for someone to purchase it, and the reason nobody is purchasing it is that nobody seems to have any money?\n\nWell, in this case, it still doesn't help to go around breaking windows.  And now Bastiat's original wording happens to *precisely* describe the resulting problem: the shopkeeper will spend six francs on the broken window, and therefore not spend six francs on something else.\n\nThe only way we can imagine that breaking a window will help this economy... is if the shopkeeper has a buried chest of silver; and when somebody throws a rock through his window, the shopkeeper spends some of this buried silver; and then the shopkeeper *doesn't* try later to top off this chest of buried silver again.  Only in that hypothetical is there actually an additional six francs added to the economy, flowing to an otherwise idle glazier, who trades with a baker that wouldn't bake otherwise, who buys from a farmer who can afford to buy more fertilizer and grow more crops than before.\n\nWould you agree with that statement -- with the paragraph as written above?  Standard economics says it is correct.\n\nBut this suggests an astonishing implication.  It seems to say that we could just *print more money* and make the shopkeeper's town better off.  Printing new money is pretty much the same as digging up money from a buried chest and not replacing it later... right?\n\n## More money, fewer problems?\n\n\"Now hold on,\" says the alert computer scientist, sitting bolt upright.  \"I know that society conditions us to think of little rectangular pieces of colored paper as super-valuable.  But dollar bills or euro bills or whatever are just *symbols* for actual goods and services that are actually valuable.  Thinking you can create more goods and services by creating more money is like counting your fingers, getting an answer of 10, erasing the 10 and writing down 11, and thinking you'll end up with 11 fingers.  Money isn't wealth, it's a claim on wealth, and if you counterfeit $100 in your bank account, you're just stealing wealth that someone else won't get.  Any theory that says you can create more wealth by creating more money, no matter how complicated the argument, will in the end turn out to be missing some row of the spreadsheet that makes the totals add up to zero.\"\n\nAnd in a *healthy* economy, this would be correct.  But remember, those idle factories are not supposed to exist in the first place.   Is it so impossible that a weird condition that shouldn't exist, could be fixed by a weird tactic that shouldn't work?\n\n\"So what you're saying,\" says the skeptical computer scientist, \"is that the two impossibilities cancel out.  Like the story about the physics student who derives $E = -mc^2,$ and who gets told to try next time to make an even number of mistakes.\"\n\nWell... yes, as it turns out.  There's even an elegant explanation, which we'll get to, for *why* those two particular impossibilities are symmetrical and cancel each other out.\n\nFirst, let's consider a more ordinary exception to the rule that creating money can't help--the reason that money exists in the first place.\n\nSuppose that Alice, Bob, and Carol are as usual stuck on a deserted island.  Alice is growing apples, Bob grows bananas, and Carol grows cucumbers.  One day Alice wants a banana, Bob wants a cucumber, and Carol wants an apple; and they all go hungry because Alice doesn't have any cucumbers to trade to Bob for a banana.  Also they don't have computers on their deserted island, so they can't do anything clever like write software to detect cycles in people's desired goods.\n\nIn this case the standard solution for this lack of computing power is... (drumroll) ...money!\n\nCreating symbolic money to add to this island, where there was no money before, can indeed the three people on the island materially better off.  Inventing money causes more trades to occur than previously; trading can make people materially better off.\n\nWhen an economy has idle factories and standing workers, it's in a state where more trades could occur, but aren't occurring.\n\nSo... adding more money to that economy, to animate more trades, isn't far from what happens when we add money to an island that doesn't have money?\n\nNow I have, indeed, pulled some wool over your eyes here.  The macroeconomic theory is waaaaay more complicated than this, in much the same way modern neural nets are a tad more complicated than just the idea of gradient descent.\n\nTo give an idea of some of the complications we are blatantly skipping over: classical economics says that destroying money should not in fact slow down an economy composed of rational actors.  In a rational world, if somebody sets fire to half of the money supply, everyone just halves their prices and life goes on.\n\nThe reason our world is *not* like that ideal world where the prices just go down, is partially that there are outstanding loans denominated in the current currency, and existing contracts denominated in the current currency.  But *most* of the problem--according to the particular economic school I happen to subscribe to--is that people who set prices are *reluctant to lower them,* in a way that an economy full of perfectly rational actors wouldn't be.\n\nAnd this is the kind of statement that causes fistfights between economists.\n\nBut there *is* widespread agreement that, for whatever reason, we don't live in the classical world of perfectly rational actors.\n\nAnd that is--on the standard theory--why fractional reserve banks blowing up and destroying money and making fewer loans, cause there to be a bunch of unemployed people and fewer jobs; and nobody being able to afford to buy things because none of their own customers can afford to buy from them.  In a modern economy, for every flow of goods, there's money flowing the other way.  So when you destroy money or slow down its flow, this can reduce the actual number of trades.\n\nWhich means that banks blowing up and thereby reducing the flow of money, can reduce the amount of flowing goods instead of prices dropping.  We are pretty sure from observation that this does in fact happen.\n\nAfter we're done clipping gradients and initializing orthogonal weights and normalizing batches, in the end deep neural nets are *still* sliding down a loss gradient.  Similarly, it really looks in theory and in historical observation like an economy with idle resources, especially *unemployed workers,* can be made materially wealthier by creating more money, which causes more trades to occur and brings the economy closer to operating at full capacity.\n\nHistorical observation also *seems* to bear this part out, although the near-impossibility of running real controlled experiments makes it hard to be sure.  The most recent case you might have heard about was in 2013 in the United States, where the \"sequester\" was going to produce a sharp cut in government spending just as the US was starting to recover a little bit, not completely, from the Great Recession.  Some people predicted the economy would tank again; and other people said it would be fine so long as the Federal Reserve created a correspondingly large amount of money, aka **monetary offset.**  And the sequester happened, and the Federal Reserve did in fact print a bunch of money, and pretty much nothing happened to the economy.  Amazing proof, right?\n\nOkay, so that's not a large number of bits of evidence by *your* standards, you spoiled brats who get to test neural nets on 127GB of training data.  But it was in fact an experimental test of two different predictions, and the economists who thought in terms of flowing money were right; and in the end, that's all we have in this life.\n\n## A general glut?\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes -- I know some of you are shuddering at the name, but he was a respected economist of his day and he came up with a clever illustration, so please bear with me -- John Maynard Keynes once came up with an illustration of what could possibly cause anything as weird as a recession, and how this could possibly be fixed by anything as weird as printing money.\n\nSuppose that on an island, Alice and Bob and Carol are growing apples and oranges and pomegranates.  Furthermore, as in the Great Depression, it is not yet the case that everyone has enough to eat.\n\nIn this situation, could there be an excess supply or \"glut\" of apples?\n\nWell, if people are still willing to eat apples, then what would \"a glut of apples\" even mean?\n\nWe answer:  Suppose Alice and Bob, who both grow apples, have such a large apple harvest that people on the island feel kind of saturated on apples, and now prefer to eat other, scarcer fruits *if available*.  In this case we'd see the relative trading value of apples dropping, compared to other fruits.  Maybe 1 apple used to be worth 1 orange, and now somebody would only trade 1 orange for 2 apples.  This would signal Alice and Bob to shift more of their effort to growing oranges and pomegranates in the future.\n\nWe could perhaps call this a \"glut\" of apples, meaning a *relative* excess of supply of apples, versus the supply/demand balance of other fruits, compared to previously.\n\nObserve that to say that apples are now cheaper in terms of oranges, is equally to say that oranges have become more expensive in terms of apples.  Then is it possible to have a glut of *every kind of fruit at once?*\n\nHow (asked Keynes) could that possibly be?  So long as Alice and Bob and Carol aren't stuffed full, so long as they would still *prefer* to eat more fruit, how could that possibly be?  You can't have *each* fruit being ultra-cheap as denominated in all the other fruits.\n\nThen what are we to think if we see Alice and Bob and Carol collectively cutting back on growing apples and oranges *and* pomegranates?\n\nHow is it possible for a whole economy to be suffering from a problem of \"excess supply,\" a situation where factories in general are going idle, without there being a corresponding surge of demand somewhere else?\n\nThe answer (said Keynes) is that the only way this \"general glut\" can happen, is if there is some additional, invisible good that people are pursuing more than apples and oranges *and* pomegranates.  What we see is the value of all three fruits falling relative to the value of this invisible good, so that people produce less of all three of them.  And the way that this can happen in real life (said Keynes) is if Alice and Bob and Carol have invented a fourth, invisible good called money.\n\nNow if there's just three people on a desert island, this would be unlikely to happen in real life.  Alice and Bob and Carol would notice what was happening and agree to just all go back to producing more fruit.\n\nBut if Alice needs fertilizer in order to get started on doing anything, for which she needs to trade apples, and Carol needs her tractor repaired, and there are in fact a heck of a lot more than three people involved, the economy can't just have an attack of common sense and snap out of its Great Depression (which was ongoing while Keynes was writing all this).\n\nIt turns out that an economy doesn't have to be very large or complex before it can have its own Great Depression.  There's a now-famous [true story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Babysitting_Co-op#Cooperative_system_and_history) about a babysitting club that created a currency that parents could trade among themselves for babysitting.  And people tried to keep a reserve of babysitting scrip so they could be sure of getting babysitting on demand.  And in fact, it turned out, people wanted to keep more scrip than the co-op made collectively available.  Soon there was less and less actual babysitting going on as a result, and the co-op nearly died.  Like a glut of apples that is symmetrically a boom in oranges, there was a glut of babysitting and a booming demand in babysitting tokens.  Only the babysitting tokens by themselves, sitting around motionless, weren't really *helping* anything.\n\nIt's the weird nature of currency as a worthless symbolic good that allows recessions and Depressions to happen in the first place.  Which is why the spreadsheet can in fact balance, and the two symmetrical impossibilities can cancel out, when we try to fix a recession by creating more money!\n\n## Aggregate demand and monetary stimulus\n\nWhen economists talk about this sort of thing, they often use the phrase \"**aggregate demand**\".\n\nActual human wants are, if not infinite, then certainly far higher than the total amount of stuff produced by the world economy.  We don't all have mansions, at least not yet.\n\nSo what \"aggregate demand\" really means is \"aggregate purchasing power\", which in turn means the total amount of flowing money trying to buy all the goods. \n\nThe standard economic view can then be stated thus: when the purely symbolic financial system blows up, and yet in the real world people lose their jobs and factories stop operating, what's happening is an \"**aggregate demand deficit**.\"  There isn't enough purchasing power to buy all the stuff the economy could supply at full capacity.\n\nThe obvious reason this happens is that exploding banks (or nowadays, banks that get bailed out, but are less enthusiastic about making more loans afterwards) reduce the total \"**money supply.**\"  There's less total symbolic money to flow through the trades.\n\nAnother reason aggregate demand decreases, is that people want to *hold on* to more money during a depression or a recession.  They have an increased preference for larger numbers in their bank accounts, and are more reluctant to spend money.  This decreases **monetary velocity.**\n\nWhen all this is starting to go wrong inside a country, conventional economics says that the central bank ought to immediately swing into action and create more money, aka \"**monetary stimulus.**\"  Or rather, the central bank is supposed to create money and use it to buy government bonds or something, and then hold onto the bonds.  Later on, when monetary velocity picks up, the central bank should sell the bonds and destroy the money it previously created, to avoid creating too much inflation.\n\nIf the central bank thinks it *can't* create enough money, then a widely advocated policy says that the country's government should instead sell treasury bonds, in exchange for money, and spend that money on... pretty much anything.  This is not in fact a null action in monetary terms--we are not just removing taxes and spending them elsewhere, or so most economists think.  The people who buy bonds in exchange for money have bonds afterwards instead of money; and this can also satisfy their desire to hold assets.  Then the money goes out the other end of the government and into circulation, where it wasn't circulating before.  This is \"**fiscal stimulus.**\"\n\nWhether it is ever a good idea to do \"fiscal stimulus\" is another one of those questions that cause economists to get into fistfights.  I personally happen to side with the school that goes around saying, \"What do you mean, the central bank *can't create enough money* to stabilize the flow of currency and trade?  Did you run out of ones and zeroes?  Why are you asking the government to increase the national debt over this?  Just do your darned job!\"\n\nI expect that this business of talking about how central banks are supposed to stabilize the national flow of money, is causing half of you to raise skeptical eyebrows and ask if maybe the whole thing would somehow stabilize itself if anyone could issue their own currency instead of it being a government monopoly.\n\nAnd the other half of you are trying to figure out some way to solve it using a blockchain.\n\nBut right now, nearly all countries have central banks.  So long as that is in fact the way things are, conventional economic theory says central banks should try to stabilize the flow of money, and hence wages, and hence employment, by constantly tweaking the amount of money in circulation.\n\nIt's not agreed among economists which countries today might be suffering from too little aggregate demand, and working under capacity.  The economists in my preferred school suspect that it is presently happening inside the European Union due to the European Central Bank being run by lunatics.  Most economists think the United States is *not* currently bounded by an aggregate demand deficit, or running far under capacity.\n\nI myself feel a bit unsure about that.  Sometimes it really seems like we could all be much happier if we all just simultaneously decided to be 10% richer.  Or that, say, Arizona, would benefit a *lot* from having its own currency to use on the side, until everyone there was working for everyone else.  But I haven't paid enough attention to the specifics here, and you probably shouldn't listen to me.\n\nSo:  If you're worried about technological unemployment due to AI advances, one of the obvious things that we should do along with any other measures we take -- that we really *really* need to do, all this abstract stuff has an enormous in-practice impact on the real economy -- is make sure that people are rich enough to buy things.\n\nIt is possible for an economy to end up in a state where most people feel poor, and can't afford to buy things from each other, and go around being sad and out of work... such that you could in fact cause everyone to perk up and trade with each other and be happy again, just by declaring that everyone has more money.  (Basic income would just move money around; the idea here is that you can make things better if *everyone simultaneously* has more money.)   If everyone thinks they're too poor to afford to hire one another, you can sometimes fix the problem by just having everyone be rich instead of poor.  If, after great advances in automation, you saw lots of people standing around doing nothing, that would be the *first* thing we ought to try.\n\nI'm going to temporarily stop going on about this because there's other economic concepts I want to run through and I don't want to risk boring you about this one topic.  We'll pick up this thread again in a later section about \"NGDP level targeting.\"\n\nFor now, I just want to observe that, compared to problems like reforming labor markets, it can be a lot simpler to just print more ones and zeroes at the central bank.  And central banks are not entirely unwilling to hear about it.  It's arguably the best choice for what's worth spending political capital to fix first.\n\n# Gently sloping supply curves, and skyrocketing prices\n\nBy now you might be starting to imagine a rosy post-automation scenario which seems *in theory* like it shouldn't be that hard to achieve.\n\nYou could look further ahead than I think we're actually going to get in practice -- not because I don't think AI can get that far, quite the opposite really, but still -- and imagine a world where robots are far more common, and human beings... are still trading with each other.\n\nA world where, if Alice knows how to grow food, and Bob knows how to build houses, then they're not both going around cold and hungry because agriculture and house-building can be automated.\n\nA world where we haven't wantonly *defined* ourselves into poverty; a word where robots exist, but we've decided to be imagine enough pretend symbolic money into existence for us to afford them.\n\nA world where, to be honest, some of the dignity of work *has* been lost.  Where the most common new jobs aren't as awesome as forging trucks out of molten steel with your bare hands.  But people still want things, and other people do those things and get paid for them.\n\nA world where people have as at least as much self-respect, where the economy is at least as vibrant, as it was in say 1960.  Because logically, any given group could always draw a line around themselves and go back to 1960s technology.  And if that group then *removes* this imaginary line, starts trading with others, and adopts more technology, then life should only get better for them.\n\nBecause of Ricardo's Law of Comparative Advantage.\n\nRight?\n\nSo... there are a number of obvious difficulties that could completely blow up this rosy scenario.\n\nOne such class of difficulties is if there's any good X that people *really* need, and that stays extremely expensive in the face of automation--if it takes months and months of babysitting to afford one unit of X.\n\nLike, say, *housing, health care,* or *college.*\n\nYou can find various graphs showing that all of the increased productivity over the last 20 years has been sucked up by increasing housing prices.  Or that all of the missing wages, as productivity rises and wages stay flat, can be accounted for by the cost to employers of health insurance.  I can't recall seeing a graph like that for college costs and student debt, but it sure ain't cheap.  If all of those graphs are true simultaneously (and they are), you can see why people might feel increasingly impoverished, even if their nominal wages in dollars are theoretically flat.\n\nAnd if those costs, or any other costs, went on rising while a hypothetical tidal wave of automation was crashing down, that could smash any utopian vision of people living peacefully on less labor in a less costly world.\n\nFor a brief but excellent overview of the *problem*, I would recommend Slate Star's \"[Considerations on Cost Disease](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/)\".  It turns out, for example, that the United States spends around \\$4000 per citizen on Medicaid and Medicare and insurance subsidies.  \\$4000 is roughly what other developed countries pay for *universal* coverage.  It's not that the United States is unwilling to pay for universal coverage, but that somehow healthcare costs far more in the United States.  (Without any visibly improved medical outcomes, of course.)\n\nThere are various aspects of all this that economists will still get into fistfights over, so I can't just hand you a standard analysis and solution.  But there's at least one important standard economic lens through which to view the problem.\n\n## Supply and demand are always equal\n\nIf we look at all the loaves of bread sold in a city on Monday, then, on that Monday, the number of loaves of bread sold, and the number of loaves bought, are equal to one another.  Every time a loaf of bread is sold, there's one person selling the loaf and one person buying a loaf.\n\nSupply and demand are always equal.\n\nImagining supply not equaling demand is like imagining a collection of nonoverlapping line segments with an odd number of endpoints.\n\nOr at least, that's how economists define the words \"supply\" and \"demand\".\n\nSo what use is such a merely tautologous equation?\n\nDefining the terms that way lets economists talk about **supply curves** and **demand curves** as a function of prices.  Or to be snootier, **supply functions** and **demand functions.**  Since supply and demand are always equal, the point where the two curves *meet* tells us the price level.\n\n\"Hold on,\" you say.  \"If supply equals demand by definition, then how would we talk about the old days of the Soviet Union, where there were 1000 people who wanted toilet paper and only 400 rolls of toilet paper?  And it was illegal for the store to raise the set price of toilet paper?  In this case, didn't demand just directly exceed supply?\"\n\nWhat was seen in Soviet supermarkes were long lines of people waiting outside before the store opened, trying to get to the toilet paper before it's all gone.  In this case, the *time spent in line* is by definition part of the 'price' of a roll of toilet paper.  No matter how the demand curve slopes--no matter how much people want toilet paper, and how reluctant they are to give up--the time required to stand in line will increase until 600 people give up and go home.  And then the monetary price of the toilet paper, *plus* the time required to stand in line, is the \"price\" at which the demand function equilibrates with the supply function.\n\nThis system wasn't good for the Soviet Union because the time spent in line was burned, destroyed, in a way that produced no additional goods.  When the price is allowed to go up under capitalism, the buyers may indeed spend more money; but just passing that money around doesn't *destroy* wealth the way that standing in line destroys time.  (The flip side is that everyone ultimately has an equal supply of time and not everyone has an equal supply of money.  Poorer people *can* sometimes benefit relative to non-poor people when part of a good is repriced in time rather than money.  Although of course sufficiently rich people will just hire someone else to stand in line.)\n\nIf you set up a cart selling \\$20 bills for \\$1 each, a line will form in front of the cart and extend until it's long enough to burn \\$18.99 worth of time, as priced by people who could otherwise earn the least amount of money per hour.  You can't *actually* sell \\$20 bills, to anyone who wants them, at a price of $1, and have that be the real entire price.\n\nA similar dynamic plays out every year when the organizers of Burning Man once again try to defy the laws of mathematics as well as capitalism in order to sell 70,000 tickets at a fixed price of \\$500.  Into a market of way more than 70,000 people who are willing to pay significantly more than \\$500.  With resale at higher prices being outlawed; your tickets are pulled at the last minute, and your car turned around and told to go home, if Burning Man found out about the resale.  The resulting scramble... well, I've heard it suggested that, in this case, the real \"price\" of the ticket is pulling on your social connections in order to obtain Burning Man tickets for a properly nominal price of \\$500, via trading favors with people who were savvy enough to sign up for the sales lottery.  Thus selecting socially savvy people to attend Burning Man.  I've never gone there.\n\n## When subsidy is futile and will be assimilated\n\nImagine a city under siege, where there are only 3,000 loaves of bread to be had, and each loaf is selling for 2 golden crowns.  Can the governor of the city ease the plight of the people by ordering the treasury to pay 1 golden crown for loaf?  The people will still be hungry -- there's still only so much bread to go around -- but perhaps their financial sorrows can be eased?\n\nNo, in fact.  The price of the 3,000 loaves of bread rises until all but 3,000 people drop out of the market for purchasing it.  If there are 3,000 people willing to pay 2 golden crowns for a loaf of bread, and the governor steps in and says the city will pay 1 golden crown per loaf of the price, then there will be 3,000 people willing to pay 2 golden crowns plus 1 golden crown subsidy.  The price of each loaf rises to 3 crowns, and the 3,000 people buying it are 2 golden crowns out of pocket, the same as before.\n\nIn economitalk, you'd say that the supply was **inflexible:** this supply curve is entirely horizontal with respect to price.  No matter how much more people pay (the x axis), the supply of bread stays the same (the y axis).\n\nThe demand curve does slope, in this example; it slopes downward as usual with increasing price, until the demand curve crosses the flat supply curve at a price point of 2 golden crowns.\n\nIf the governor then adds a subsidy of 1 golden crown to each purchase of bread, we are in effect *shifting the demand curve to the right* along the x-axis - the demand for bread at 2 golden crowns, is now the demand level we would have previously seen at a price of 1 golden crown.  We have had a change of variables: Demand(x') = Demand(x - 1 crown).  Since the supply curve is flat, this just means that the two curves meet at a price' which is 1 golden crown greater than the old price.\n\nIn other words:  It doesn't help any buyers to try to subsidize a good in inflexible supply.  The only way subsidies can *possibly* help buyers *at all,* is if increasing the price of the good causes more of the good to exist.\n\n## Skyrocketing prices\n\nA price can only skyrocket when a gently sloping demand curve meets a gently sloping supply curve.\n\nIf the demand curve slopes sharply downward, this describes a state of affairs where, as the price of the good increases, lots of people *rapidly* become unwilling to pay and drop out of the market before the price has moved very far.\n\nIf the supply curve slopes sharply upward, the price can't increase very far.  As the price goes up, the market is rapidly flooded with more sellers seeking to produce the good.\n\nBut if the city of San Francisco refuses to build more than a handful of apartments, and a large number of people in search of jobs *really* want to live in San Francisco and do *not* want to be driven out even as prices go up... then prices go *way* up.  Until, however reluctantly, the least wealthy people are driven out.\n\n\"I already knew that,\" you say.  Okay, but now consider health care and college.\n\nIn the United States there are, if I recall correctly, only 350 people allowed to become orthodontists every year.  That is how many residents the orthodontic schools have decided to accept.  Everyone else gets turned away.\n\nFor as long as that *deeply* entrenched system holds, it can accomplish literally nothing to try to subsidize orthodontics.  You cannot cause more poor children to have braces by having the government offer to pay part of the costs of orthodontia.  350 orthodontists per year can only put braces on a limited number of children.  No amount of shuffling money around or tweaking insurance regulations can allow more children to have braces than that.  \n\nOnce upon a time after World War II, the US government passed a GI bill subsidizing college for military veterans.  And in actual practical reality... a lot more people ended up going to college!  So there must have been more colleges springing up, or existing colleges must have expanded to serve more students.  That's the only possible way that more total people could have gone to college.\n\nLater, US society decided there still weren't enough people going to college.  So the US government offered to subsidize insurance on student loans, in order to allow more students to get bank loans to pay for college.  And what happened that time... is that US college prices skyrocketed.  So now people are leaving college with a crippling, immiserating load of student debt, and if you don't like that, don't go to college.\n\nSo: the second time a subsidy was tried, there was some kind of increased barrier or difficulty to starting a new college.  Or at least, it was hard to start a new college that the new students actually wanted to go to.  We can also infer that the demand function sloped down very slowly with increasing price: lots of people *really really* wanted to go to college.  Or go to a non-horrible college with an existing reputation, instead of a new for-profit college that nobody had heard about.  And existing reputable colleges were unwilling or unable to expand.  We know all this, because otherwise the price couldn't have skyrocketed.\n\nYou can't *effectively* subsidize housing unless higher housing prices can cause there to be more housing.\n\nYou can't effectively subsidize education unless higher tuitions can cause new attractive universities to spring up, or old reputable universities to expand.\n\nThere's literally nothing you can do to cause more people to have more healthcare by moving around insurance premiums, unless the resulting higher prices are causing more doctors and more hospitals to exist.\n\nAll this \"cost disease\" isn't a simple issue for our civilization, and economists don't agree on exactly what's happening, let alone what to do about it.\n\nOn the other hand, politicians almost always *only* talk about demand -- who purchases the good, how much they pay.  They talk about supply not at all.  They talk about mortgage tax deductions and federally insured mortgages; restrictions on building apartments, not so much.  When costs go up, they talk about the need for higher subsidies instead of asking why supply isn't already expanding.  \"Where are the new colleges?\" they don't cry.  \"How do we have so few hospitals, with prices so high?\" they don't say.  \"We must do something about the limited number of orthodontic residencies so that more children can have braces!\" you will never hear any legislator say.  Which is, on standard economics, a recipe for prices that never stop going up.\n\nIf you were around for the 2008 Presidential election in the US, there was this a case where some gasoline refineries had broken down, and thus the US was experiencing a gasoline shortage with correspondingly high prices.\n\nAnd there was floated a proposal to temporarily repeal some gasoline taxes...\n\n...which would have been a *pure gift* to existing gasoline refineries.  The total supply of gasoline was price-unresponsive; it physically couldn't go up until new refineries were built or repaired.  The situation was almost perfectly analogous to the city under siege in which there were only 3000 loaves of bread and no more could be made.\n\nPretty much every academic economist in the United States, Republican and Democrat alike, agreed in unison:  \"Lifting the gas tax will not change prices at the pump.  It won't even cause gas stations to make more money.  Literally the only people who benefit from shifting this demand curve to the right are the owners of gasoline refineries.\"\n\nJohn McCain was in favor of temporarily lifting the gas tax.  Hillary Clinton was in favor of temporarily lifting the gas tax.  In an extraordinary moment that stunned all of us who knew economics, Barack Obama came out *against* lifting the tax.\n\nOf course McCain and Clinton almost certainly knew why the measure would be futile.  And they probably weren't in the pay of gas refinery owners either.  What's going on, I think, is that political journalists *believe* that voters are too stupid to understand literally any abstraction whatsoever.  It doesn't matter whether or not journalists are correct about that, because so long as journalists *believe* that, they will report on any discussion of economics as a blunder in the political horse race.  And politicians know that being reported on as having 'blundered' can be fatal.  So McCain and Clinton didn't dare publicly oppose decreased gas taxes, even though they both knew it was stupid.  Or something.\n\nI haven't the tiniest idea what to do about that.\n\nThe *cost disease* across housing, education, and above all, medicine, seems like it could all by itself smash an otherwise pleasant outcome where everything gets cheaper as a result of automation.\n\nI have no idea how anyone in AI or machine learning can do anything to help solve this.\n\nSomehow or other, the political equilibrium seems to naturally forbid any politician to mention, at all, what economics would suggest as the actual key elements of the problem.\n\nI have no good ideas on how to solve that either.  Maybe you do.\n\nWhat standard economics does say is that you *can't* solve the cost disease by having the government pay more or trying to move existing subsidies around.  You can't help it with a startup that makes doing medical paperwork more efficient.  To make costs come down, you need to either (a) make people stop wanting surgeons, bachelors' degrees, and bedrooms; or (b) you need to somehow make more of those things exist, in a world where supply is currently not increasing even as the prices are already skyrocketing.",

      "text": "This is a FAQ aimed at a very rapid introduction to key standard economic concepts to professionals in AI and machine learning who have become concerned with the potential economic impacts of their work, or who want to participate in conversations about the economic impact of present and future Artificial Intelligence.\n\nYou will in fact need a strong intuitive understanding of \"comparative advantage\", and several other key concepts, to talk sensibly about a declining labor force participation rate and what ought to be done about it.  Just like you yourself might perhaps feel a bit frustrated when trying to discuss which professions are liable to be automated in the near future, with somebody who doesn't understand the notion of gradient descent and why some human jobs have loss functions that are harder to measure and differentiate.  It's not that the concepts are mathematically hard in an absolute sense, it's that you really do need to be parsing the world using those basic concepts.  I won't belabor this point any further.\n\nWithout further ado, here's a quick list of some concepts that this particular author thinks are important:\n\n- **Comparative advantage** says that even if Alice is less efficient (less productive) at all of her tasks than is Bob, Alice and Bob still both benefit from being able to trade with one another.\n - If Alice is *relatively* twice as good at growing apples than she is at growing oranges, and Bob is relatively twice as good at growing oranges than growing apples, Alice and Bob can both benefit by trading her apples for his oranges, even if Bob can grow 10 times as many apples per unit of labor than Alice.\n- The **lump of labour fallacy** is the standard term for the (appealing but incorrect) reasoning which says that if you automate away 95% of the jobs, only 5% of the people remain employed.\n - Humanity did in fact automate away 95% of all labor during the industrial revolution - 98% of the population used to be farmers, and now it's 3% - and yet more than 5% of the people still have jobs.\n - The standard explanation for why we aren't all already unemployed revolves around **complementary inputs:** if each sausage-in-a-bun requires 1 sausage and 1 bun, and it previously took 20 units of labor to make 10 sausages and 10 units of labor to make 10 sausage buns, and then sausage-making productivity doubles, the classically predicted new equilibrium is 15 sausages in 15 buns.\n - Maybe this is, in fact, not what is happening right now.  But it's definitely what happened during most of human history, and you need to intuitively understand the background classical prediction in order to *not* just try to reinterpret the present situation through the eyes of the lump of labour fallacy.\n- The **broken window fallacy** is the standard term for the (appealing but incorrect) reasoning which says that if you heave a rock through somebody's window, they have to pay the glazier to repair the window, and the glazier buys bread from the baker, and so production thrives and everybody is better off.\n - The key to understanding *why* this is a fallacy will revolve around the concept of **aggregate demand**.  Under normal conditions the economy should be bounded by the available supply of glass and similar goods, and destroying goods in one place diverts them from somewhere else.  Modern economies *can* get into wedged states where glaziers are sitting idle; and the economy is then bounded by a different quantity, the amount of flowing money available to animate trades.  But heaving a rock through a window doesn't increase this quantity either.\n- When a good has a relatively low-sloped **supply curve** (curve for supply versus price), subsidizing that good will tend to increase its price much more than the amount of that good.\n - If you make it easier for people to take out loans to go to universities, but it's not very easy to build lots of new universities, the result is that people end up with a lot of student loan debt.\n- \"Inequality\" in a bad sense usually results from **rent extraction.**  Under some conditions, equilibrium extractible rents sometimes only go up when people's incomes would otherwise rise.\n - Reading articles written by actual poor people in the US gives the strong impression that one's top priority for helping them ought to be outlawing towing fees.\n - This is one potential thing that might go wrong with the basic income.  It might possibly just cause the Ferguson Police Department to issue more tickets, unless you fix the Ferguson Police Department first.\n - Excessive intellectual property protection can also cause excess concentration of rents.\n - Economies of scale in dealing with regulators -- being able to afford lawyers -- can effectively protect big companies from competition and enable them to extract monopoly rents.\n- **Labor market flexibility** (aka the ability of people to move around and match up with available jobs) is a critical factor in employment.  This can be hindered by e.g. restrictions on building more housing in cities with high labor demand.\n - We could equally view this as due to major employers continuing to situate new jobs in the cities with already-skyrocketing housing prices.  (One observes that, often, these housing costs are relatively far less burdensome on the high-level decision makers who decide where to put the company.)\n- **Effective marginal tax rates** are how much benefit accrues to somebody who earns 1 more dollar at their current wage level.  Not just due to income taxes and payroll taxes, but also due to phasing-out of benefits, it's possible for somebody who earns +$1 to be effectively +$0.20 better off, or even for this number to go negative.\n - Current estimates of effective marginal tax rates in low income brackets are usually in the range of 70% and on many 'cliffs' higher than 100%.\n- Alternatives to minimum wage include **wage subsidies.**\n - We can consider the minimum wage as a subsidy on wages paid for by a marginal tax on employers who hire people at less than the minimum wage.  If society thinks this subsidy is a good idea, it should almost certainly not be paid for by those particular employers.\n- Alternatives to labor taxes include **land value tax** and **consumption taxes.**\n - If you tax labor, you'll discourage labor.  Taxing the implicit rents on land doesn't cause there to be less land, so it's a less distortive tax.\n- **Sticky prices** of labor, especially **downward sticky** wages, cause small amounts of deflation to do far more damage to economies than small amounts of deflation.\n - This is one reason why modern economics suggests trying to stabilize an economy at 2% inflation rather than 0% inflation; small amounts of inflation help prices adjust to new realities over time.\n - There's an up-and-coming view, not yet fully adopted, which rephrases the view as being about the total amount of flowing money, and says that people lose their jobs when there isn't enough flowing money to pay their wages.  This view suggests that the best help monetary policy can give to employment is **targeting a price level** of **per-capita NGDP.**\n\nMany readers will also have ideas about:\n\n- Regulatory burdens on employers decreasing employment.\n- \"Regulatory capture\" by large corporations influencing regulators to make it harder for new entrants to compete with them.\n- Regulatory compliance costs generally decreasing economic productivity.\n\nThere is not universal agreement on how large these problems are, or whether they should be top priorities.  But standard economics does not regard these ideas as *naive,* so I won't discuss them any further in this FAQ.  My purpose here is to introduce relatively more technical concepts, that are more likely to be new to the reader, and that refute views widely regarded by professional economists as being misguided on technical grounds.\n\nThis document is currently incomplete, and the Table of Contents below shows what is currently covered.\n\n[toc:]\n\n# Comparative advantage, and the mercantilist fallacy\n\n**Ricardo's Law of Comparative Advantage** says that parties (individuals, groups, countries) can both benefit from trading with each other, even when one party has an **absolute advantage** over the other in every factor of production.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- Alice can produce 20 apples per unit of labor, and 10 oranges per unit of labor.\n- Bob can produce 50 apples per unit of labor, and 100 oranges per unit of labor.\n- Alice and Bob both have 10 units of labor to use.\n\nIf Alice wants an equal number of apples and oranges, she's better off producing 200 apples with all of her labor, and then trading 100 of the apples to Bob for 100 oranges.\n\nBob in turn is better off producing 100 oranges with 1 unit of labor, and trading them to Alice for 100 apples, than Bob would be if he used 2 units of labor to produce 100 apples directly.\n\nEconomists usually regard this idea as refuting some widespread intuitions about **mercantilism,** which says that countries are better off the more they sell to other countries, and worse off the more they buy from other countries.\n\nAnother possibly-not-intuitive consequence of comparative advantage is that, except for *sticky prices* (see below), the exchange rates on a country's currency have little long-run effect on its trade.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- Germany buys 100,000 dollars from the US for 100,000 euros;\n- Germany then uses these 100,000 dollars to buy 100 air conditioners from the US;\n- People in the US use their 100,000 euros to buy 10 cars from Germany.\n\nOne day the European Central Bank decides to print enough new euros to halve the value of the currency.  Then:\n\n- People in Germany buy 100,000 dollars from people in the US, using 200,000 euros.\n- People in Germany buy 100 air conditioners from the US for $1000 each.\n- People in the US buy 10 cars from Germany, each of which now costs 20,000 euros.\n\nRicardo's Law thus suggests that we can view the US as shipping 100 air conditioners to Germany in exchange for 10 cars, with the currency exchange rates being something of an epiphenomenon.  (In practice this is modified by \"sticky prices\" in that some people already own euros or dollars, or bonds denominated in euros or dollars, and there are existing sales contracts that fix prices for a term.  But effects like that tend to wash out over the longer run.)\n\nThe concept of comparative advantage is important for discussing technological unemployment because it conveys the general idea that when we draw a line around a group or region, like \"{Alice, Bob, and Carol}\" or \"Wisconsin\", this collective entity is not harmed by being able to trade with someone else who is more productive than them.  (To say nothing of getting their *own* advanced technology.)\n\nThis isn't to say that technological advances can never hurt Wisconsin's economy.  Maybe Wisconsin is trading cheese to Ohio in exchange for coal.  One day, Michigan becomes much more efficient than Wisconsin at producing cheese, causing Ohio to start trading with Michigan instead.  This can hurt Wisconsin's economy, quite a lot in fact.\n\nThe conclusion from Ricardo's Law is rather that Wisconsin can't be harmed by the fact of Wisconsin *itself* being allowed to trade with Michigan.  What hurts Wisconsin in the above scenario is that *Ohio* is allowed to trade with Michigan.  Wisconsin can only make itself even worse off by choosing to cut off its own trade with Michigan.\n\nIf Wisconsin closes its borders and tries to get along in its own little world that doesn't include those awful new cheese-making machines, Ricardo's Law says that Wisconsin as a whole *should* become worse-off thereby.  If this stops being true, then some unusual phenomenon must be at work, one that violates the broad axioms under which Ricardo's Law is a theorem.\n\nAn intuition I'll be trying to pump throughout this FAQ is that the state of affairs over most of human history, in which technological automation made most people better off without causing them to be permanently unemployed, is a very normal state of affairs from the standpoint of economic theory.  If we're currently looking at lasting unemployment caused by automation, this is a *surprising* state of affairs.\n\nAnd:  Even if something has changed and something weird is going on, the reason for it won't be that Ricardo's Law suddenly stopped being a theorem.  Whatever the truth turns out to be, Ricardo's Law will still be a relatively better lens than mercantilism through which to understand it.\n\n# Complementary inputs, and the lump of labour fallacy\n\nBroadly speaking, the \"**lump of labour fallacy**\" is reasoning as if there's a limited amount of work to be done in the world, and a limited number of jobs to go around, and every time one of those jobs is automated away, one more person ends up unemployed.\n\nSuppose that:\n\n- People like to eat sausages in buns.\n- Each sausage-in-a-bun requires 1 sausage and 1 bun as an input, and a trivial amount of labor to assemble.\n- At present, it requires 1 unit of labor to make a bun, and 2 units of labor to make a sausage.\n- The resulting equilibrium involves 10 sausages-in-a-bun being manufactured by 30 people expending 30 units of labor.\n\nSo then the critical question becomes: if we invent a new kind of sausage-making machine that doubles productivity and makes it possible to produce 2 sausages using 2 units of labor, do we...\n\n- End up with 10-sausages-in-a-bun produced by 20 people, and 10 unemployed former sausage makers?\n- End up with 15-sausages-in-a-bun produced by 30 people?\n\nEnding up in the second equilibrium, maybe not right away, is widely regarded as the core idea behind how we could start with a world where 98% of the population were farmers, improving agricultural productivity by a factor of 100 between then and now, and end up with a world in which 3% of the people are farmers and the other 95% of the population are *not* unemployed.\n\nOne way of looking at this is that, over the course of human history so far, *everything* has behaved like it is complementary.  When agricultural productivity skyrocketed, a bunch of people went into making shoes and clothes and tables and houses.  The end result was that more people had food, more people had more nice clothes and furniture, and *not* that most of the population ended up unemployed.  The \"food\" input to a human became cheaper, and labor went into making more of the \"clothes\" and \"furniture\" inputs to humans.  Then again later, when manufacturing productivity skyrocketed, more people went into services.\n\nNow it could be that this phenomenon is now breaking down for any number of possible reasons.  But among those reasons, it seems relatively implausible that we have reached *the end of demand* and that all the people now have enough of every kind of good and service that they want.  There are way too many poor and unhappy people still in the world for that to be true!\n\nOkay, so we haven't reached the end of human wants.  But maybe some people in the modern world can no longer produce *anything* that other people want...?\n\nI'd like to encourage you to regard this idea with some surprise.  Especially the notion that this \"unnecessariat\" exists today, before we can reliably build a robot that puts away the dishes from a dishwasher without breaking them.  AI is making progress, but we haven't exactly reached par-human perception and motor skills, yet.  Are there really people in the world who can do *nothing* that *anybody* else with money wants?\n\nHeck, why can't those people trade with each other?  Why can't people in this supposed unnecessariat at least help each other, and get their own economy going, even if nobody else wants to trade with them?  And doesn't Ricardo's Law say that this state of affairs ought to provide a floor on the group's minimum economic activity, since in theory the group can only benefit further by trading with the outside world...?\n\nWhy *isn't* it an economic theorem that there's never any unemployment?\n\nI would encourage you to stare at this argument and try to feel surprised that unemployment exists.  It's not that theorems get to overrule reality; if a valid theorem fails to describe reality, that just says one of the axioms must be empirically false.  But we do know that *more* must be going on in the existence of unemployment, than there being a limited lump of jobs and not enough jobs for all the people.\n\n- If you are a neoliberal, you are likely to think about minimum wages, payroll taxes, occupational licensing, and regulatory burdens.  If the state imposes a minimum cost and minimum danger on hiring someone, people may not be able to produce anything that is worth the price and risk to their employer.\n- If you are Tyler Cowen, you will worry that some people in the labor pool are actively destructive; that lawsuits have made it harder for employers to use word-of-mouth to distinguish destructive people; and that people who have been unemployed for a while, end up in a global pool of people who on *average* produce \"zero marginal product\".\n- If you are of a more leftist persuasion, you may worry that the billionaires are running out of real wants, and that the people who *do* want things don't have enough money to buy them.\n- If you are a Georgist, you are liable to observe that \"unemployed\" people can't build houses for each other and can't farm food for each other, because the state has decided that these people own zero land; so they aren't allowed to get started anywhere.\n\nAnd so on.  There are more than enough possible hypotheses to explain why unemployment can possibly exist.  Still, it's worth noting that there was *less* lasting unemployment in, say, 1850.  What changed between then and now... could be all the regulations saying you can't just go build somebody a house.  Or it could be increased inequality.  Or it could be housing prices preventing people from moving to California where there are jobs.\n\nBut it's relatively much stranger to postulate that the *only* problem is that we're running out of jobs in the global lump of labor as AI advances eat away at the lump.\n\nIt could indeed be that existing AI, and to a much larger degree, ordinary computer programming, has gone a long way towards devaluing many jobs that can be done without a college degree.\n\nLabor force participation is in fact dropping under current conditions, whatever those are.  It's possible and maybe probable that, all else being equal, AI conquering more perceptual and motor tasks will make more people permanently unemployed.\n\nIt's reasonable for people in AI to feel concerned about this and want to make things better.\n\nBut it's unlikely that the issue is the end of human want, or the running-out of the lump of labor.  The problem may not be that some people have *intrinsically* nothing left to contribute to any remaining human want; but rather, that the modern world has put obstacles in the way of people being allowed to contribute.\n\nRegardless:  However you look at the situation, and whatever solution you propose, please don't talk about AI or trade or automation \"destroying jobs.\"  This will cause any economists listening to scream in silent horror that they cannot give voice.\n\n# The broken window fallacy, and aggregate demand\n\n## Surprisingly, recessions exist\n\nIn theory, when we double the productivity of sausage-makers, we should get 15 sausages-in-buns instead of 10.  We should not get 10 unemployed sausage-makers; or, if we temporarily get 10 unemployed sausage-makers, that state of affairs shouldn't last longer than it takes sausage-makers to become willing to look for work at the booming bun factories with HELP WANTED signs plastered all over their windows.\n\nAnd yet there seem to be these occasions, like the \"Great Depression\" or the \"Great Recession\", when there are silent factories and people standing idle, or the modern equivalent.  The unemployed sausage-makers are willing to look for new jobs, but there aren't tons of HELP WANTED signs to let them get started on retraining.  The bun factories are actually making fewer buns, because now the unemployed sausage-makers aren't buying sausages-in-a-bun anymore.\n\nOne will observe, however, that these historical occasions seem to come on suddenly, and *not* due to sudden brilliant inventions causing a huge jump in productivity.  They happen at around the same time that there's trouble in the financial system--banks blowing up.\n\nFurthermore, the number of idle factories and amount of idle labor seems to be far in excess of what could reasonably be accounted for by sausage-makers needing to change jobs.  And even people with what might seem like very useful skills, can't find anywhere to put them to use.  None of the previous reasons we've considered, for why unemployment could possibly exist, seem to apply to how *that* much unemployment could exist in the Great Depression.  And then a decade later all those people had jobs again, too; so it wasn't something intrinsic to the people or the jobs that caused them to be unemployed for so long.\n\nThat is weird and astonishing!  If your brain doesn't currently think that is weird and astonishing, please try at least briefly to get yourself into the state of mind where it is.\n\n## The broken window fallacy\n\nAs my entry point into explaining this astonishing paradox, I'm going to take an unusual angle and start with the **broken window fallacy.**\n\nThe broken window fallacy was originally pointed out in 1850 by Frederic Bastiat, in a now-famous essay, \"[That Which Is Seen, And That Which Is Not Seen](http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html)\"  Bastiat begins with the parable of a child who has accidentally thrown a rock through somebody's window:\n\n> Have you ever witnessed the anger of the good shopkeeper, when his careless son happened to break a square of glass? If you have been present at such a scene, you will most assuredly bear witness to the fact, that every one of the spectators, were there even thirty of them, by common consent apparently, offered the unfortunate owner this invariable consolation — \"It is an ill wind that blows nobody good. Everybody must live, and what would become of the glaziers if panes of glass were never broken?\"\n\nAnd doesn't the glazier, in turn, spend money at the baker, and the shoemaker, and the baker and shoemaker spend money at the mill and tannery?  Doesn't all of society end up benefiting from this broken window?\n\n> Now, this form of condolence contains an entire theory, which it will be well to show up in this simple case, seeing that it is precisely the same as that which, unhappily, regulates the greater part of our economical institutions.\n>\n> Suppose it cost six francs to repair the damage, and you say that the accident brings six francs to the glazier's trade — that it encourages that trade to the amount of six francs — I grant it; I have not a word to say against it; you reason justly. The glazier comes, performs his task, receives his six francs, rubs his hands, and, in his heart, blesses the careless child. All this is that which is seen.\n>\n> But if, on the other hand, you come to the conclusion, as is too often the case, that it is a good thing to break windows, that it causes money to circulate, and that the encouragement of industry in general will be the result of it, you will oblige me to call out, \"Stop there! your theory is confined to that which is seen; it takes no account of that which is not seen.\"\n>\n> It is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, or added another book to his library. In short, he would have employed his six francs in some way, which this accident has prevented.\n\nBastiat's point was widely accepted as persuasive; or at least, it was accepted by economists.\n\nLet us nonetheless notice that Bastiat's original essay is worded in a bit of an odd way.  Why focus on the fact that when the shopkeeper has spent six francs in one place, he therefore can't spend six francs somewhere else?  If the limiting factor is just money, couldn't we make all of society better off by adding more money?\n\nYou would ordinarily expect a healthy economy to be limited by its resources, by the available sand and heat for making glass.  If the glazier replaces one window, he isn't replacing another.  Or if some other seller provides the glazier with more sand and coal, to make more glass than he otherwise would've, then that's coal which isn't going to the smithy.\n\nOf course what Bastiat really meant is that sending resources to repair a broken window calls away those resources from somewhere else.  This is *symbolized* by the six francs being spent in one place rather than another.\n\nThat's how a market economy works, after all: when goods flow in one direction, money flows in the other direction.  Six francs flow from the shopkeeper to the glazier; a glass window travels in the opposite direction.\n\nSo Bastiat talks about a change in a flow of francs, as a shorthand for talking about what really matters, a corresponding change in the opposite flow of goods.\n\nNow ask:  What if the economy is, somehow, Greatly Depressed?  What if the glazier was standing idle until the window was broken, and isn't being called away from any other job?  What if there's a ton of coal in an empty lot, waiting for someone to purchase it, and the reason nobody is purchasing it is that nobody seems to have any money?\n\nWell, in this case, it still doesn't help to go around breaking windows.  And now Bastiat's original wording happens to *precisely* describe the resulting problem: the shopkeeper will spend six francs on the broken window, and therefore not spend six francs on something else.\n\nThe only way we can imagine that breaking a window will help this economy... is if the shopkeeper has a buried chest of silver; and when somebody throws a rock through his window, the shopkeeper spends some of this buried silver; and then the shopkeeper *doesn't* try later to top off this chest of buried silver again.  Only in that hypothetical is there actually an additional six francs added to the economy, flowing to an otherwise idle glazier, who trades with a baker that wouldn't bake otherwise, who buys from a farmer who can afford to buy more fertilizer and grow more crops than before.\n\nWould you agree with that statement -- with the paragraph as written above?  Standard economics says it is correct.\n\nBut this suggests an astonishing implication.  It seems to say that we could just *print more money* and make the shopkeeper's town better off.  Printing new money is pretty much the same as digging up money from a buried chest and not replacing it later... right?\n\n## More money, fewer problems?\n\n\"Now hold on,\" says the alert computer scientist, sitting bolt upright.  \"I know that society conditions us to think of little rectangular pieces of colored paper as super-valuable.  But dollar bills or euro bills or whatever are just *symbols* for actual goods and services that are actually valuable.  Thinking you can create more goods and services by creating more money is like counting your fingers, getting an answer of 10, erasing the 10 and writing down 11, and thinking you'll end up with 11 fingers.  Money isn't wealth, it's a claim on wealth, and if you counterfeit $100 in your bank account, you're just stealing wealth that someone else won't get.  Any theory that says you can create more wealth by creating more money, no matter how complicated the argument, will in the end turn out to be missing some row of the spreadsheet that makes the totals add up to zero.\"\n\nAnd in a *healthy* economy, this would be correct.  But remember, those idle factories are not supposed to exist in the first place.   Is it so impossible that a weird condition that shouldn't exist, could be fixed by a weird tactic that shouldn't work?\n\n\"So what you're saying,\" says the skeptical computer scientist, \"is that the two impossibilities cancel out.  Like the story about the physics student who derives $E = -mc^2,$ and who gets told to try next time to make an even number of mistakes.\"\n\nWell... yes, as it turns out.  There's even an elegant explanation, which we'll get to, for *why* those two particular impossibilities are symmetrical and cancel each other out.\n\nFirst, let's consider a more ordinary exception to the rule that creating money can't help--the reason that money exists in the first place.\n\nSuppose that Alice, Bob, and Carol are as usual stuck on a deserted island.  Alice is growing apples, Bob grows bananas, and Carol grows cucumbers.  One day Alice wants a banana, Bob wants a cucumber, and Carol wants an apple; and they all go hungry because Alice doesn't have any cucumbers to trade to Bob for a banana.  Also they don't have computers on their deserted island, so they can't do anything clever like write software to detect cycles in people's desired goods.\n\nIn this case the standard solution for this lack of computing power is... (drumroll) ...money!\n\nCreating symbolic money to add to this island, where there was no money before, can indeed the three people on the island materially better off.  Inventing money causes more trades to occur than previously; trading can make people materially better off.\n\nWhen an economy has idle factories and standing workers, it's in a state where more trades could occur, but aren't occurring.\n\nSo... adding more money to that economy, to animate more trades, isn't far from what happens when we add money to an island that doesn't have money?\n\nNow I have, indeed, pulled some wool over your eyes here.  The macroeconomic theory is waaaaay more complicated than this, in much the same way modern neural nets are a tad more complicated than just the idea of gradient descent.\n\nTo give an idea of some of the complications we are blatantly skipping over: classical economics says that destroying money should not in fact slow down an economy composed of rational actors.  In a rational world, if somebody sets fire to half of the money supply, everyone just halves their prices and life goes on.\n\nThe reason our world is *not* like that ideal world where the prices just go down, is partially that there are outstanding loans denominated in the current currency, and existing contracts denominated in the current currency.  But *most* of the problem--according to the particular economic school I happen to subscribe to--is that people who set prices are *reluctant to lower them,* in a way that an economy full of perfectly rational actors wouldn't be.\n\nAnd this is the kind of statement that causes fistfights between economists.\n\nBut there *is* widespread agreement that, for whatever reason, we don't live in the classical world of perfectly rational actors.\n\nAnd that is--on the standard theory--why fractional reserve banks blowing up and destroying money and making fewer loans, cause there to be a bunch of unemployed people and fewer jobs; and nobody being able to afford to buy things because none of their own customers can afford to buy from them.  In a modern economy, for every flow of goods, there's money flowing the other way.  So when you destroy money or slow down its flow, this can reduce the actual number of trades.\n\nWhich means that banks blowing up and thereby reducing the flow of money, can reduce the amount of flowing goods instead of prices dropping.  We are pretty sure from observation that this does in fact happen.\n\nAfter we're done clipping gradients and initializing orthogonal weights and normalizing batches, in the end deep neural nets are *still* sliding down a loss gradient.  Similarly, it really looks in theory and in historical observation like an economy with idle resources, especially *unemployed workers,* can be made materially wealthier by creating more money, which causes more trades to occur and brings the economy closer to operating at full capacity.\n\nHistorical observation also *seems* to bear this part out, although the near-impossibility of running real controlled experiments makes it hard to be sure.  The most recent case you might have heard about was in 2013 in the United States, where the \"sequester\" was going to produce a sharp cut in government spending just as the US was starting to recover a little bit, not completely, from the Great Recession.  Some people predicted the economy would tank again; and other people said it would be fine so long as the Federal Reserve created a correspondingly large amount of money, aka **monetary offset.**  And the sequester happened, and the Federal Reserve did in fact print a bunch of money, and pretty much nothing happened to the economy.  Amazing proof, right?\n\nOkay, so that's not a large number of bits of evidence by *your* standards, you spoiled brats who get to test neural nets on 127GB of training data.  But it was in fact an experimental test of two different predictions, and the economists who thought in terms of flowing money were right; and in the end, that's all we have in this life.\n\n## A general glut?\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes -- I know some of you are shuddering at the name, but he was a respected economist of his day and he came up with a clever illustration, so please bear with me -- John Maynard Keynes once came up with an illustration of what could possibly cause anything as weird as a recession, and how this could possibly be fixed by anything as weird as printing money.\n\nSuppose that on an island, Alice and Bob and Carol are growing apples and oranges and pomegranates.  Furthermore, as in the Great Depression, it is not yet the case that everyone has enough to eat.\n\nIn this situation, could there be an excess supply or \"glut\" of apples?\n\nWell, if people are still willing to eat apples, then what would \"a glut of apples\" even mean?\n\nWe answer:  Suppose Alice and Bob, who both grow apples, have such a large apple harvest that people on the island feel kind of saturated on apples, and now prefer to eat other, scarcer fruits *if available*.  In this case we'd see the relative trading value of apples dropping, compared to other fruits.  Maybe 1 apple used to be worth 1 orange, and now somebody would only trade 1 orange for 2 apples.  This would signal Alice and Bob to shift more of their effort to growing oranges and pomegranates in the future.\n\nWe could perhaps call this a \"glut\" of apples, meaning a *relative* excess of supply of apples, versus the supply/demand balance of other fruits, compared to previously.\n\nObserve that to say that apples are now cheaper in terms of oranges, is equally to say that oranges have become more expensive in terms of apples.  Then is it possible to have a glut of *every kind of fruit at once?*\n\nHow (asked Keynes) could that possibly be?  So long as Alice and Bob and Carol aren't stuffed full, so long as they would still *prefer* to eat more fruit, how could that possibly be?  You can't have *each* fruit being ultra-cheap as denominated in all the other fruits.\n\nThen what are we to think if we see Alice and Bob and Carol collectively cutting back on growing apples and oranges *and* pomegranates?\n\nHow is it possible for a whole economy to be suffering from a problem of \"excess supply,\" a situation where factories in general are going idle, without there being a corresponding surge of demand somewhere else?\n\nThe answer (said Keynes) is that the only way this \"general glut\" can happen, is if there is some additional, invisible good that people are pursuing more than apples and oranges *and* pomegranates.  What we see is the value of all three fruits falling relative to the value of this invisible good, so that people produce less of all three of them.  And the way that this can happen in real life (said Keynes) is if Alice and Bob and Carol have invented a fourth, invisible good called money.\n\nNow if there's just three people on a desert island, this would be unlikely to happen in real life.  Alice and Bob and Carol would notice what was happening and agree to just all go back to producing more fruit.\n\nBut if Alice needs fertilizer in order to get started on doing anything, for which she needs to trade apples, and Carol needs her tractor repaired, and there are in fact a heck of a lot more than three people involved, the economy can't just have an attack of common sense and snap out of its Great Depression (which was ongoing while Keynes was writing all this).\n\nIt turns out that an economy doesn't have to be very large or complex before it can have its own Great Depression.  There's a now-famous [true story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Babysitting_Co-op#Cooperative_system_and_history) about a babysitting club that created a currency that parents could trade among themselves for babysitting.  And people tried to keep a reserve of babysitting scrip so they could be sure of getting babysitting on demand.  And in fact, it turned out, people wanted to keep more scrip than the co-op made collectively available.  Soon there was less and less actual babysitting going on as a result, and the co-op nearly died.  Like a glut of apples that is symmetrically a boom in oranges, there was a glut of babysitting and a booming demand in babysitting tokens.  Only the babysitting tokens by themselves, sitting around motionless, weren't really *helping* anything.\n\nIt's the weird nature of currency as a worthless symbolic good that allows recessions and Depressions to happen in the first place.  Which is why the spreadsheet can in fact balance, and the two symmetrical impossibilities can cancel out, when we try to fix a recession by creating more money!\n\n## Aggregate demand and monetary stimulus\n\nWhen economists talk about this sort of thing, they often use the phrase \"**aggregate demand**\".\n\nActual human wants are, if not infinite, then certainly far higher than the total amount of stuff produced by the world economy.  We don't all have mansions, at least not yet.\n\nSo what \"aggregate demand\" really means is \"aggregate purchasing power\", which in turn means the total amount of flowing money trying to buy all the goods. \n\nThe standard economic view can then be stated thus: when the purely symbolic financial system blows up, and yet in the real world people lose their jobs and factories stop operating, what's happening is an \"**aggregate demand deficit**.\"  There isn't enough purchasing power to buy all the stuff the economy could supply at full capacity.\n\nThe obvious reason this happens is that exploding banks (or nowadays, banks that get bailed out, but are less enthusiastic about making more loans afterwards) reduce the total \"**money supply.**\"  There's less total symbolic money to flow through the trades.\n\nAnother reason aggregate demand decreases, is that people want to *hold on* to more money during a depression or a recession.  They have an increased preference for larger numbers in their bank accounts, and are more reluctant to spend money.  This decreases **monetary velocity.**\n\nWhen all this is starting to go wrong inside a country, conventional economics says that the central bank ought to immediately swing into action and create more money, aka \"**monetary stimulus.**\"  Or rather, the central bank is supposed to create money and use it to buy government bonds or something, and then hold onto the bonds.  Later on, when monetary velocity picks up, the central bank should sell the bonds and destroy the money it previously created, to avoid creating too much inflation.\n\nIf the central bank thinks it *can't* create enough money, then a widely advocated policy says that the country's government should instead sell treasury bonds, in exchange for money, and spend that money on... pretty much anything.  This is not in fact a null action in monetary terms--we are not just removing taxes and spending them elsewhere, or so most economists think.  The people who buy bonds in exchange for money have bonds afterwards instead of money; and this can also satisfy their desire to hold assets.  Then the money goes out the other end of the government and into circulation, where it wasn't circulating before.  This is \"**fiscal stimulus.**\"\n\nWhether it is ever a good idea to do \"fiscal stimulus\" is another one of those questions that cause economists to get into fistfights.  I personally happen to side with the school that goes around saying, \"What do you mean, the central bank *can't create enough money* to stabilize the flow of currency and trade?  Did you run out of ones and zeroes?  Why are you asking the government to increase the national debt over this?  Just do your darned job!\"\n\nI expect that this business of talking about how central banks are supposed to stabilize the national flow of money, is causing half of you to raise skeptical eyebrows and ask if maybe the whole thing would somehow stabilize itself if anyone could issue their own currency instead of it being a government monopoly.\n\nAnd the other half of you are trying to figure out some way to solve it using a blockchain.\n\nBut right now, nearly all countries have central banks.  So long as that is in fact the way things are, conventional economic theory says central banks should try to stabilize the flow of money, and hence wages, and hence employment, by constantly tweaking the amount of money in circulation.\n\nIt's not agreed among economists which countries today might be suffering from too little aggregate demand, and working under capacity.  The economists in my preferred school suspect that it is presently happening inside the European Union due to the European Central Bank being run by lunatics.  Most economists think the United States is *not* currently bounded by an aggregate demand deficit, or running far under capacity.\n\nI myself feel a bit unsure about that.  Sometimes it really seems like we could all be much happier if we all just simultaneously decided to be 10% richer.  Or that, say, Arizona, would benefit a *lot* from having its own currency to use on the side, until everyone there was working for everyone else.  But I haven't paid enough attention to the specifics here, and you probably shouldn't listen to me.\n\nSo:  If you're worried about technological unemployment due to AI advances, one of the obvious things that we should do along with any other measures we take -- that we really *really* need to do, all this abstract stuff has an enormous in-practice impact on the real economy -- is make sure that people are rich enough to buy things.\n\nIt is possible for an economy to end up in a state where most people feel poor, and can't afford to buy things from each other, and go around being sad and out of work... such that you could in fact cause everyone to perk up and trade with each other and be happy again, just by declaring that everyone has more money.  (Basic income would just move money around; the idea here is that you can make things better if *everyone simultaneously* has more money.)   If everyone thinks they're too poor to afford to hire one another, you can sometimes fix the problem by just having everyone be rich instead of poor.  If, after great advances in automation, you saw lots of people standing around doing nothing, that would be the *first* thing we ought to try.\n\nI'm going to temporarily stop going on about this because there's other economic concepts I want to run through and I don't want to risk boring you about this one topic.  We'll pick up this thread again in a later section about \"NGDP level targeting.\"\n\nFor now, I just want to observe that, compared to problems like reforming labor markets, it can be a lot simpler to just print more ones and zeroes at the central bank.  And central banks are not entirely unwilling to hear about it.  It's arguably the best choice for what's worth spending political capital to fix first.\n\n# Gently sloping supply curves, and skyrocketing prices\n\nBy now you might be starting to imagine a rosy post-automation scenario which seems *in theory* like it shouldn't be that hard to achieve.\n\nYou could look further ahead than I think we're actually going to get in practice -- not because I don't think AI can get that far, quite the opposite really, but still -- and imagine a world where robots are far more common, and human beings... are still trading with each other.\n\nA world where, if Alice knows how to grow food, and Bob knows how to build houses, then they're not both going around cold and hungry because agriculture and house-building can be automated.\n\nA world where we haven't wantonly *defined* ourselves into poverty; a word where robots exist, but we've decided to be imagine enough pretend symbolic money into existence for us to afford them.\n\nA world where, to be honest, some of the dignity of work *has* been lost.  Where the most common new jobs aren't as awesome as forging trucks out of molten steel with your bare hands.  But people still want things, and other people do those things and get paid for them.\n\nA world where people have as at least as much self-respect, where the economy is at least as vibrant, as it was in say 1960.  Because logically, any given group could always draw a line around themselves and go back to 1960s technology.  And if that group then *removes* this imaginary line, starts trading with others, and adopts more technology, then life should only get better for them.\n\nBecause of Ricardo's Law of Comparative Advantage.\n\nRight?\n\nSo... there are a number of obvious difficulties that could completely blow up this rosy scenario.\n\nOne such class of difficulties is if there's any good X that people *really* need, and that stays extremely expensive in the face of automation--if it takes months and months of babysitting to afford one unit of X.\n\nLike, say, *housing, health care,* or *college.*\n\nYou can find various graphs showing that all of the increased productivity over the last 20 years has been sucked up by increasing housing prices.  Or that all of the missing wages, as productivity rises and wages stay flat, can be accounted for by the cost to employers of health insurance.  I can't recall seeing a graph like that for college costs and student debt, but it sure ain't cheap.  If all of those graphs are true simultaneously (and they are), you can see why people might feel increasingly impoverished, even if their nominal wages in dollars are theoretically flat.\n\nAnd if those costs, or any other costs, went on rising while a hypothetical tidal wave of automation was crashing down, that could smash any utopian vision of people living peacefully on less labor in a less costly world.\n\nFor a brief but excellent overview of the *problem*, I would recommend Slate Star's \"[Considerations on Cost Disease](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/)\".  It turns out, for example, that the United States spends around \\$4000 per citizen on Medicaid and Medicare and insurance subsidies.  \\$4000 is roughly what other developed countries pay for *universal* coverage.  It's not that the United States is unwilling to pay for universal coverage, but that somehow healthcare costs far more in the United States.  (Without any visibly improved medical outcomes, of course.)\n\nThere are various aspects of all this that economists will still get into fistfights over, so I can't just hand you a standard analysis and solution.  But there's at least one important standard economic lens through which to view the problem.\n\n## Supply and demand are always equal\n\nIf we look at all the loaves of bread sold in a city on Monday, then, on that Monday, the number of loaves of bread sold, and the number of loaves bought, are equal to one another.  Every time a loaf of bread is sold, there's one person selling the loaf and one person buying a loaf.\n\nSupply and demand are always equal.\n\nImagining supply not equaling demand is like imagining a collection of nonoverlapping line segments with an odd number of endpoints.\n\nOr at least, that's how economists define the words \"supply\" and \"demand\".\n\nSo what use is such a merely tautologous equation?\n\nDefining the terms that way lets economists talk about **supply curves** and **demand curves** as a function of prices.  Or to be snootier, **supply functions** and **demand functions.**  Since supply and demand are always equal, the point where the two curves *meet* tells us the price level.\n\n\"Hold on,\" you say.  \"If supply equals demand by definition, then how would we talk about the old days of the Soviet Union, where there were 1000 people who wanted toilet paper and only 400 rolls of toilet paper?  And it was illegal for the store to raise the set price of toilet paper?  In this case, didn't demand just directly exceed supply?\"\n\nWhat was seen in Soviet supermarkes were long lines of people waiting outside before the store opened, trying to get to the toilet paper before it's all gone.  In this case, the *time spent in line* is by definition part of the 'price' of a roll of toilet paper.  No matter how the demand curve slopes--no matter how much people want toilet paper, and how reluctant they are to give up--the time required to stand in line will increase until 600 people give up and go home.  And then the monetary price of the toilet paper, *plus* the time required to stand in line, is the \"price\" at which the demand function equilibrates with the supply function.\n\nThis system wasn't good for the Soviet Union because the time spent in line was burned, destroyed, in a way that produced no additional goods.  When the price is allowed to go up under capitalism, the buyers may indeed spend more money; but just passing that money around doesn't *destroy* wealth the way that standing in line destroys time.  (The flip side is that everyone ultimately has an equal supply of time and not everyone has an equal supply of money.  Poorer people *can* sometimes benefit relative to non-poor people when part of a good is repriced in time rather than money.  Although of course sufficiently rich people will just hire someone else to stand in line.)\n\nIf you set up a cart selling \\$20 bills for \\$1 each, a line will form in front of the cart and extend until it's long enough to burn \\$18.99 worth of time, as priced by people who could otherwise earn the least amount of money per hour.  You can't *actually* sell \\$20 bills, to anyone who wants them, at a price of $1, and have that be the real entire price.\n\nA similar dynamic plays out every year when the organizers of Burning Man once again try to defy the laws of mathematics as well as capitalism in order to sell 70,000 tickets at a fixed price of \\$500.  Into a market of way more than 70,000 people who are willing to pay significantly more than \\$500.  With resale at higher prices being outlawed; your tickets are pulled at the last minute, and your car turned around and told to go home, if Burning Man found out about the resale.  The resulting scramble... well, I've heard it suggested that, in this case, the real \"price\" of the ticket is pulling on your social connections in order to obtain Burning Man tickets for a properly nominal price of \\$500, via trading favors with people who were savvy enough to sign up for the sales lottery.  Thus selecting socially savvy people to attend Burning Man.  I've never gone there.\n\n## When subsidy is futile and will be assimilated\n\nImagine a city under siege, where there are only 3,000 loaves of bread to be had, and each loaf is selling for 2 golden crowns.  Can the governor of the city ease the plight of the people by ordering the treasury to pay 1 golden crown for loaf?  The people will still be hungry -- there's still only so much bread to go around -- but perhaps their financial sorrows can be eased?\n\nNo, in fact.  The price of the 3,000 loaves of bread rises until all but 3,000 people drop out of the market for purchasing it.  If there are 3,000 people willing to pay 2 golden crowns for a loaf of bread, and the governor steps in and says the city will pay 1 golden crown per loaf of the price, then there will be 3,000 people willing to pay 2 golden crowns plus 1 golden crown subsidy.  The price of each loaf rises to 3 crowns, and the 3,000 people buying it are 2 golden crowns out of pocket, the same as before.\n\nIn economitalk, you'd say that the supply was **inflexible:** this supply curve is entirely horizontal with respect to price.  No matter how much more people pay (the x axis), the supply of bread stays the same (the y axis).\n\nThe demand curve does slope, in this example; it slopes downward as usual with increasing price, until the demand curve crosses the flat supply curve at a price point of 2 golden crowns.\n\nIf the governor then adds a subsidy of 1 golden crown to each purchase of bread, we are in effect *shifting the demand curve to the right* along the x-axis - the demand for bread at 2 golden crowns, is now the demand level we would have previously seen at a price of 1 golden crown.  We have had a change of variables: Demand(x') = Demand(x - 1 crown).  Since the supply curve is flat, this just means that the two curves meet at a price' which is 1 golden crown greater than the old price.\n\nIn other words:  It doesn't help any buyers to try to subsidize a good in inflexible supply.  The only way subsidies can *possibly* help buyers *at all,* is if increasing the price of the good causes more of the good to exist.\n\n## Skyrocketing prices\n\nA price can only skyrocket when a gently sloping demand curve meets a gently sloping supply curve.\n\nIf the demand curve slopes sharply downward, this describes a state of affairs where, as the price of the good increases, lots of people *rapidly* become unwilling to pay and drop out of the market before the price has moved very far.\n\nIf the supply curve slopes sharply upward, the price can't increase very far.  As the price goes up, the market is rapidly flooded with more sellers seeking to produce the good.\n\nBut if the city of San Francisco refuses to build more than a handful of apartments, and a large number of people in search of jobs *really* want to live in San Francisco and do *not* want to be driven out even as prices go up... then prices go *way* up.  Until, however reluctantly, the least wealthy people are driven out.\n\n\"I already knew that,\" you say.  Okay, but now consider health care and college.\n\nIn the United States there are, if I recall correctly, only 350 people allowed to become orthodontists every year.  That is how many residents the orthodontic schools have decided to accept.  Everyone else gets turned away.\n\nFor as long as that *deeply* entrenched system holds, it can accomplish literally nothing to try to subsidize orthodontics.  You cannot cause more poor children to have braces by having the government offer to pay part of the costs of orthodontia.  350 orthodontists per year can only put braces on a limited number of children.  No amount of shuffling money around or tweaking insurance regulations can allow more children to have braces than that.  \n\nOnce upon a time after World War II, the US government passed a GI bill subsidizing college for military veterans.  And in actual practical reality... a lot more people ended up going to college!  So there must have been more colleges springing up, or existing colleges must have expanded to serve more students.  That's the only possible way that more total people could have gone to college.\n\nLater, US society decided there still weren't enough people going to college.  So the US government offered to subsidize insurance on student loans, in order to allow more students to get bank loans to pay for college.  And what happened that time... is that US college prices skyrocketed.  So now people are leaving college with a crippling, immiserating load of student debt, and if you don't like that, don't go to college.\n\nSo: the second time a subsidy was tried, there was some kind of increased barrier or difficulty to starting a new college.  Or at least, it was hard to start a new college that the new students actually wanted to go to.  We can also infer that the demand function sloped down very slowly with increasing price: lots of people *really really* wanted to go to college.  Or go to a non-horrible college with an existing reputation, instead of a new for-profit college that nobody had heard about.  And existing reputable colleges were unwilling or unable to expand.  We know all this, because otherwise the price couldn't have skyrocketed.\n\nYou can't *effectively* subsidize housing unless higher housing prices can cause there to be more housing.\n\nYou can't effectively subsidize education unless higher tuitions can cause new attractive universities to spring up, or old reputable universities to expand.\n\nThere's literally nothing you can do to cause more people to have more healthcare by moving around insurance premiums, unless the resulting higher prices are causing more doctors and more hospitals to exist.\n\nAll this \"cost disease\" isn't a simple issue for our civilization, and economists don't agree on exactly what's happening, let alone what to do about it.\n\nOn the other hand, politicians almost always *only* talk about demand -- who purchases the good, how much they pay.  They talk about supply not at all.  They talk about mortgage tax deductions and federally insured mortgages; restrictions on building apartments, not so much.  When costs go up, they talk about the need for higher subsidies instead of asking why supply isn't already expanding.  \"Where are the new colleges?\" they don't cry.  \"How do we have so few hospitals, with prices so high?\" they don't say.  \"We must do something about the limited number of orthodontic residencies so that more children can have braces!\" you will never hear any legislator say.  Which is, on standard economics, a recipe for prices that never stop going up.\n\nIf you were around for the 2008 Presidential election in the US, there was this a case where some gasoline refineries had broken down, and thus the US was experiencing a gasoline shortage with correspondingly high prices.\n\nAnd there was floated a proposal to temporarily repeal some gasoline taxes...\n\n...which would have been a *pure gift* to existing gasoline refineries.  The total supply of gasoline was price-unresponsive; it physically couldn't go up until new refineries were built or repaired.  The situation was almost perfectly analogous to the city under siege in which there were only 3000 loaves of bread and no more could be made.\n\nPretty much every academic economist in the United States, Republican and Democrat alike, agreed in unison:  \"Lifting the gas tax will not change prices at the pump.  It won't even cause gas stations to make more money.  Literally the only people who benefit from shifting this demand curve to the right are the owners of gasoline refineries.\"\n\nJohn McCain was in favor of temporarily lifting the gas tax.  Hillary Clinton was in favor of temporarily lifting the gas tax.  In an extraordinary moment that stunned all of us who knew economics, Barack Obama came out *against* lifting the tax.\n\nOf course McCain and Clinton almost certainly knew why the measure would be futile.  And they probably weren't in the pay of gas refinery owners either.  What's going on, I think, is that political journalists *believe* that voters are too stupid to understand literally any abstraction whatsoever.  It doesn't matter whether or not journalists are correct about that, because so long as journalists *believe* that, they will report on any discussion of economics as a blunder in the political horse race.  And politicians know that being reported on as having 'blundered' can be fatal.  So McCain and Clinton didn't dare publicly oppose decreased gas taxes, even though they both knew it was stupid.  Or something.\n\nI haven't the tiniest idea what to do about that.\n\nThe *cost disease* across housing, education, and above all, medicine, seems like it could all by itself smash an otherwise pleasant outcome where everything gets cheaper as a result of automation.\n\nI have no idea how anyone in AI or machine learning can do anything to help solve this.\n\nSomehow or other, the political equilibrium seems to naturally forbid any politician to mention, at all, what economics would suggest as the actual key elements of the problem.\n\nI have no good ideas on how to solve that either.  Maybe you do.\n\nWhat standard economics does say is that you *can't* solve the cost disease by having the government pay more or trying to move existing subsidies around.  You can't help it with a startup that makes doing medical paperwork more efficient.  To make costs come down, you need to either (a) make people stop wanting surgeons, bachelors' degrees, and bedrooms; or (b) you need to somehow make more of those things exist, in a world where supply is currently not increasing even as the prices are already skyrocketing.",
