      "text": "Ashley:  So, you said you were going to tell me about... Solomon's induction?\n\nBlaine:  Solomonoff induction.  Goes back to the 1960s and the mathematician Ray Solomonoff.  The key idea in Solomonoff induction is to do sequence prediction by having a probability distribution over -\n\nAshley:  Wait.  Before you launch right into an explanation of what Solomonoff induction *is*, I'd like you to try to tell me what it *does*, or why people study it in the first place.  I find that helps me organize my listening.\n\nBlaine:  Um... okay.  Let me think for a second...\n\nAshley:  Also, while I can imagine things that \"sequence prediction\" might mean, I haven't actually encountered it in a technical context, so you'd better go a bit further back and start more at the beginning.  I do know what a probability distribution is.\n\nBlaine:  Okay.  So... one way of framing the usual reason why people study this sort of thing in the first place, is that sometimes, by studying what it would be possible to do with unlimited computing power, we can gain valuable intuitions about epistemology - that's, uh, the field that studies how to reason about factual questions, how to build a map of reality that reflects the territory...\n\nAshley:  I have some idea what 'epistemology' is, yes.  But I think you might need to start even further back, maybe with some sort of concrete example or something.\n\nBlaine:  Okay.  Um.  So one anecdote that I sometimes use to frame the value of computer science to the study of epistemology, is Edgar Allen Poe's argument in 1833 that chess was uncomputable.\n\nAshley:  That doesn't sound like a thing that actually happened.\n\nBlaine:  I know, but it totally *did* happen and not in a metaphorical sense either!  Edgar Allen Poe wrote an essay explaining why no automaton would ever be able to play chess, and he specifically mentioned \"Mr. Babbage's computing engine\" as an example.  You see, in the nineteenth century, there was for a time this sensation known as the Mechanical Turk - supposedly a machine, an automaton, that could play chess.  At the grandmaster level, no less.  Now today, when we're accustomed to the idea that a computer chip needs to be doing billions of operations per second to play chess, you or I know *immediately* that the Mechanical Turk must have been a fraud and that there must have been a concealed operator inside - a midget, as it turned out - especially when, if you reached out to upset one of the Turk's pieces, the Turk would reach back out and set it back up again, and if you kept on doing it, the Turk would refuse to play, and so on.  *Today* we know that this sort of thing is *hard* to build into a machine.  But in the 19th century, even that much wasn't known.  So when Edgar Allen Poe, who besides being an author was also an accomplished magician, set out to write an essay about the Mechanical Turk, he spent the *second* half of the essay dissecting what was known about the Turk's appearance to (correctly) figure out where the human operator was hiding.  But Poe spent the *first* half of the essay arguing that no automaton - nothing like Mr. Babbage's computing engine - could possibly play chess, which was how he knew *a priori* that the Turk had a concealed human operator.\n\nAshley:  And what was Poe's argument?\n\nBlaine:  Poe observed that in an algebraical problem, each step followed from the previous step of necessity, which was why the steps in solving an algebraical problem could be represented by the deterministic motions of gears in something like Mr. Babbage's computing engine.  But in a chess problem, Poe said, there are many possible chess moves, and no move follows with necessity from the position of the board; and even if you did select one move, the opponent's move would not follow with necessity, so you couldn't represent it with the determined motion of automatic gears.  Therefore, Poe said, whatever was operating the Mechanical Turk must have the nature of Cartesian mind, rather than the nature of deterministic matter, and this was knowable *a priori*.  And then he started figuring out where the required operator was hiding.\n\nAshley:  That's... actually really impressive reasoning, and completely wrong at the same time.\n\nBlaine:  I know!  Isn't it great?\n\nAshley:  I mean, that sounds like Poe correctly identified the *hard* part of playing computer chess - the branching factor of moves and countermoves - the reason why no *simple* machine could do it, and he just didn't realize that a deterministic machine could deterministically check many possible moves in order to figure out the game tree.  So close, and yet so far.\n\nBlaine:  More than a century later, in 1950, Claude Shannon published the first paper ever written on computer chess... and in passing, Shannon gave the formula for playing perfect chess if you had unlimited computing power, the algorithm you'd use to extrapolate the entire game tree.  We could say that Shannon gave a short program that would solve chess if you ran it on a hypercomputer, where a hypercomputer is an ideal computer that can run any finite computation immediately.  And *then* Shannon passed on to talking about the problem of locally guessing how good a board position was, so that you could play chess using only a *small* search.  I say all this to make a point about the value of knowing how to solve problems using hypercomputers, even though hypercomputers don't exist.  Yes, there's often a *huge* gap between the unbounded solution and the practical solution.  It wasn't until 1997, forty-seven years after Shannon's paper giving the unbounded solution, that Deep Blue actually won the world chess championship -\n\nAshley:  And that wasn't just a question of faster computing hardware running Shannon's ideal search algorithm.  There were a lot of new insights along the way, most notably the alpha-beta pruning algorithm and a lot of improvements in positional evaluation.\n\nBlaine:  Right!  But I think some people overreact to that forty-seven year gap, and act like it's *worthless* to have an unbounded understanding of a computer program, just because you might still be forty-seven years away from a practical solution.  But if you don't even have a solution that would run on a hyercomputer, you're Poe in 1833, not Shannon in 1950.  The reason I tell the anecdote about Poe is to illustrate that Poe was *confused* about computer chess in a way that Shannon was not.  When we don't know how to solve a problem even given infinite computing power, the very work we are trying to do is in some sense murky to us.  When we can state code that would solve the problem given a hypercomputer, we have become *less* confused.  Once we have the unbounded solution we understand, in some basic sense, *the kind of work we are trying to perform,* and then we can try to figure out how to do it *efficiently* -\n\nAshley:  Which may well require new insights into the structure of the problem, or even a conceptual revolution in how we imagine the work we're trying to do.\n\nBlaine:  Yes, but the point is that *you can't even get started on that* if you're arguing about how playing chess has the nature of Cartesian mind rather than matter, because deterministic gear motions can't represent non-determined chess moves.  At that point you're not 50 years away from winning the chess championship, you're 150 years away, because it took an extra 100 years to move humanity's understanding to the point where you could easily see how to play chess using a hypercomputer.  I'm not trying to exalt the unbounded solution by denigrating the work required to get a bounded solution, I'm not saying that when we have an unbounded solution we're practically there and the rest is a matter of mere lowly efficiency, I'm trying to compare having the unbounded solution to the horrific confusion of *not knowing what kind of work we're trying to do.*\n\nAshley:  Okay.  I think I understand why, on your view, it's important to know how to solve problems using infinitely fast computers, or hypercomputers as you call them; when we can say how to answer a question using infinite computing power, that means we crisply understand the question itself, in some sense, while if we can't figure out how to solve a problem using unbounded computing power, that means we're confused about the problem in some sense.  I can see that, yes.  I mean, if you've ever tried to teach the more doomed sort of undergraduate to write computer programs, you pick up a pretty clear sense of what it means to be confused about what it takes to compute something.  So what does this have to do with \"Solomonoff induction\"?\n\nBlaine:  Ah!  Well, suppose I asked you how to do epistemology using infinite computing power?\n\nAshley:  My good fellow, I would at once reply, \"Beep.  Whirr.  Problem 'do epistemology' not crisply specified.\"  At this stage of affairs, I do not think this reply indicates any fundamental confusion on my part; rather I think it is you who must be clearer.  And don't tell me that 'epistemology' means 'how we should reason in order to construct an accurate map of reality,' because that's still not crisply specified.\n\nBlaine:  Well, perhaps.  But even there I would suggest that it's a mark of intellectual progress to be able to take vague and underspecified ideas like 'do good epistemology' and turn them *into* crisply specified problems.  Imagine that I went up to my friend Cecil, and said, \"How would you do good epistemology given unlimited computing power and a short Python program?\" and Cecil at once came back with an answer, and it was actually a pretty reasonable and good answer once explained.  Cecil would probably know something quite interesting that you do not presently know - for one thing, the knowledge of *a good way to formalize* the problem of 'doing good epistemology' in the first place.\n\nAshley:  I confess to being rather skeptical of this hypothetical.  But if that actually happened - if I agreed, to my own satisfaction, that someone had stated a short Python program that would 'do good epistemology' if run on an unboundedly fast computer - then I agree that I'd probably have learned something *quite interesting* about epistemology.\n\nBlaine:  What Cecil knows about, in this hypothetical, is Solomonoff induction.  In the same way that Claude Shannon answered \"Given infinite computing power, how would you play perfect chess?\", Ray Solomonoff answered \"Given infinite computing power, how would you perfectly find the best hypothesis that fits the facts?\"\n\nAshley:  Suddenly, I find myself strongly suspicious of whatever you are about to say to me.\n\nBlaine:  That's understandable.\n\nAshley:  In particular, I'll ask at once whether \"Solomonoff induction\" assumes that our *hypotheses* are being given to us on a silver platter by the programmers along with the exact data we're supposed to explain, or whether the algorithm is organizing its own data from a big messy situation and *inventing* good hypotheses from scratch -\n\nBlaine:  Great question!  It's the second one.\n\nAshley:  Really?  Okay, now I have to ask whether Solomonoff induction is a recognized concept in good standing in the field of academic computer science, because that does not sound like something modern-day computer science knows how to do.\n\nBlaine:  I wouldn't say it's a widely known concept, but it's one that's in good academic standing.  I don't think any professor that knew about it would hesitate to teach it.  The method isn't used in modern machine learning because it requires an infinitely fast computer and isn't easily approximated the way that chess is.\n\nAshley:  This really sounds *very* suspicious.  Last time I checked, we hadn't *begun* to formalize the creation of good new hypotheses from scratch.  I've heard about claims to have 'automated' the work that, say, Newton did in inventing classical mechanics, and I've found them all to be incredibly dubious.  Which is to say, they were rigged demos and lies.\n\nBlaine:  I know, but -\n\nAshley:  And then I'm even more suspicious of a claim that someone's algorithm would solve this problem if only they had infinite computing power.  Having some researcher claim that their Good-Old-Fashioned AI semantic network *would* be intelligent if run on a computer so large that, conveniently, nobody can ever test their theory, is not going to persuade me.\n\nBlaine:  ...Do I really strike you as that much of a charlatan?  What have I ever done to you, that you would expect me to try pulling a scam like that?\n\nAshley:  That's fair.  I shouldn't accuse you of planning that scam when I haven't seen you say it.  But I'm pretty sure the problem of \"coming up with good new hypotheses in a world full of messy data\" is basically AI-complete, like, solving this problem means you have strong AI.  And I don't see how else you could claim that we have an algorithm for that given sufficiently large computers.  I mean, even Mentif-\n\nBlaine:  Do not say the name, or he will appear!\n\nAshley:  Sorry.  But even the legendary first and greatest of all AI crackpots, He-Who-Googles-His-Name, could assert that his algorithms would be all-powerful on a computer large enough to make his claim unfalsifiable.  So what?\n\nBlaine:  That's a very sensible reply given your current background knowledge and this, again, is *exactly* the kind of mental state that reflects a problem that is *confusing* rather than just *hard to implement.*  It's the sort of confusion Poe might feel in 1833, or close to it.  In other words, it's just the sort of conceptual issue we *would* have solved at the point where we could state a short program that could run on a hypercomputer.  Which Ray Solomonoff did in 1964.\n\nAshley:  Okay.  Fine.  Let's hear about this general solution to epistemology.\n\nBlaine:  First, try to solve the following puzzle.  1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29...?\n\nAshley:  Let me look at those for a moment... 47.\n\nBlaine:  Congratulations on engaging in, as we snooty types would call it, 'sequence prediction'.\n\nAshley:  I'm following you so far.\n\nBlaine:  The smarter you are, the more easily you can find the hidden patterns in sequences and predict them successfully. You had to notice the resemblance to the Fibonacci rule to guess the next number. Someone who didn't already know about Fibonacci, or who was worse at mathematical thinking, would have taken longer to understand the sequence or maybe never learned to predict it at all.\n\nAshley: Still with you.\n\nBlaine: It's not a sequence of *numbers* per se... but can you see how the question, \"The sun has risen on the last million days. What is the probability that it rises tomorrow?\" could be viewed as a kind of sequence prediction problem?\n\nAshley: Only if some programmer neatly parses up the world into a series of \"Did the Sun rise on day X starting in 4.5 billion BCE, 0 means no and 1 means yes?  1, 1, 1, 1, 1...\" and so on.  Which is exactly the sort of shenanigan that I see as cheating.\n\nBlaine:  I agree that's cheating.  But suppose I have a robot running around with a webcam showing it a 1920x1080 pixel field that refreshes 60 times a second with 32-bit colors.  I could view that as a giant sequence and ask the robot to predict what it will see happen when it rolls out to watch a sunrise the next day.\n\nAshley: I can't help but notice that the 'sequence' of webcam frames is absolutely enormous... oh, right, computers much bigger than the universe. And now you're smiling evilly, so I guess that's the point. I also notice that the sequence is no longer deterministically predictable, that it is no longer a purely mathematical object, and that the sequence of webcam frames observed will depend on the robot's choices. This makes me feel a bit shaky about the analogy to predicting the mathematical sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\nBlaine: I'll try to address those points in order. First, Solomonoff induction is about assigning *probabilities* to the next item in the sequence. I mean, if I showed you a box that said 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 you would not be absolutely certain that the next item would be 13. There could be some more complicated rule that just looked Fibonacci-ish but then diverged. You might guess with 90% probability but not 100% probability, or something like that.\n\nAshley: Didn't you say that Solomonoff was a mathematician?  Because this has stopped feeling like math.\n\nBlaine: There is a *large* branch of math, to say nothing of computer science, that deals in probabilities and statistical prediction.  We are going to be describing absolutely lawful and deterministic ways of assigning probabilities after seeing 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18.\n\nAshley:  Okay, but if you're later going to tell me that this lawful probabilistic prediction rule underlies a generally intelligent epistemological reasoner, I'm already skeptical.  No matter how large a computer it's run on, I find it hard to imagine that some simple set of rules for assigning probabilities is going to encompass truly and generally intelligent answers about sequence prediction, like Terence Tao would give after looking at the sequence for a while.  We just have no idea how Terence Tao works, so we can't duplicate his abilities in a formal rule, no matter how much computing power that rule gets... you're smiling evilly again.  I'll be *quite* interested if that evil smile turns out to be justified.\n\nBlaine:  Indeed.\n\nAshley: I also find it hard to imagine that this deterministic mathematical rule for assigning probabilities would notice if the box was outputting an ASCII-encoded version of Hamlet's speech in Shakespeare, which I would notice eventually though maybe not right away... and you're *still* smiling evilly.\n\nBlaine:  Indeed.  That is *exactly* what Solomonoff induction does.  Furthermore, we have theorems establishing that Solomonoff induction can do it way better than you or Terence Tao.\n\nAshley:  A *theorem* proves this.  As in a necessary mathematical truth.  Even though we have no idea how Terence Tao works empirically... and there's evil smile number four.  Okay.  I am *very* skeptical, but willing to be convinced.\n\nBlaine:  So if you actually did have a hypercomputer, you could *cheat*, right?  And Solomonoff induction is the most ridiculously cheating cheat in the history of cheating.\n\nAshley:  Go on.\n\nBlaine:  We just run all possible computer programs to see which are the simplest computer programs that best predict the data seen so far, and use those programs to predict what comes next.  This mixture contains, among other things, an exact copy of Terence Tao, thereby allowing us to prove theorems about their relative performance.\n\nAshley:  What.\n\nBlaine:  That's what the equation for Solomonoff induction says.\n\nAshley:  Is this an actual reputable math thing?  I mean really?\n\nBlaine:  Yes, it is.  I'll get to formalizing the math shortly, but you did ask me to first state the point of it all.  The point of Solomonoff induction is that it gives us a gold-standard ideal for sequence prediction, and this gold-standard prediction only errs by a bounded amount, over infinite time, relative to the best computable sequence predictor.  We can also see it as formalizing the intuitive idea that was expressed by William Ockham a few centuries earlier that simpler theories are more likely to be correct, and as telling us that 'simplicity' should be measured in algorithmic complexity, which is the size of a computer program required to output a hypothesis's predictions.\n\nAshley:  I think I would have to read more on this subject to actually follow that.  What I'm hearing is that Solomonoff induction is a reputable idea that is important because it gives us a kind of ideal for sequence prediction.  This ideal also has something to do with Occam's Razor and the idea that the simplest theory is the one that can be represented by the shortest computer program.  You identify this with \"doing good epistemology\".\n\nBlaine:  Yes, those are legitimate takeaways.  Another way of looking at it is that Solomonoff induction is an ideal but uncomputable answer to the question \"What should our priors be?\", which is left open by understanding Bayesian updating.\n\nAshley:  Can you say how Solomonoff induction answers the question of, say, the prior probability that Canada is planning to invade the United States?  To name one example of a thing I've seen being estimated ludicrously high on a crackpot website that actually tried to invoke Bayesian probability about it.  Does Solomonoff induction let me tell him that he's making a math error, instead of just calling him an idiot in an admittedly informal fashion?\n\nBlaine:  If you're expecting to sit down with Leibniz and say, \"Gentlemen, let us calculate\" then you're setting your expectations too high.  Solomonoff gives us an idea of how we *should* compute that quantity given *unlimited* computing power.  It *doesn't* give us a firm procedural recipe for how we can best approximate that ideal in real life using bounded computing power or human brains.  Knowing the ideal, we *can* extract some intuitive advice that might help our online crackpot if only he'd actually listen to it.\n\nAshley:  But according to you, Solomonoff induction does say in principle what is the prior probability that Canada will invade the United States.\n\nBlaine:  Yes, up to a choice of universal Turing machine.\n\nAshley *(looking highly skeptical):*  So I plug a universal Turing machine into the formalism, and in principle, I get out a uniquely determined probability that Canada invades the US.  No free variables left once I pick the UTM.\n\nBlaine:  Exactly.\n\nAshley:  Walk me through exactly how that works again?\n\nBlaine:  So, first, we have to transform this into a sequence prediction problem.\n\nAshley:  Like a sequence of years in which Canada has and hasn't invaded the US, mostly zero except around 1812 -\n\nBlaine:  *No!*  To get a good prediction about Canada we need much more data than that, and I don't mean a dump of Canadian GDP either.  Imagine a sequence that contains all the sensory data you have ever received over your lifetime - not just the hospital room that you saw when you opened your eyes right after your birth, but the darkness your brain received as input while you were still in your mother's womb.  Every word you've ever heard.  Every letter you've ever seen on a computer screen, not as ASCII letters but as the raw pattern of neural impulses that gets sent down from your retina.  And also in this sequence is every nerve impulse you've ever sent to your muscles, every motion of your fingers, every breath your brain orders your lungs to draw in.\n\nAshley:  That seems like a lot of data and some of it is redundant, there'll be lots of similar pixels for blue sky -\n\nBlaine:  That data is what *you* got as an agent.  Like, that data is the Sequence of the Ashley-Agent.\n\nAshley:  Is that a technical term I should know, or -\n\nBlaine:  No, I was trying to be metaphorical.  What I'm saying is, if we want to translate the question of the prediction problem Ashley faces into theoretical terms, we should give the sequence predictor *all* the data that you had available, including all those repeating blue pixels of the sky.  Who knows?  Maybe there was a Canadian warplane in there that you didn't notice.\n\nAshley:  I think I'm with you so far.  But why does your sequence include my actions?  Aren't those my outputs, not my inputs?  My finger motions don't happen to me as sensory data, I decide them and output them myself -\n\nBlaine:  Solomonoff induction in the original formalism is about sequence prediction, a problem that doesn't include actions.  \n\n# (in progress)\n\nAshley:  If your sequence is trying to include *all* the data I have, it seems incomplete.  There are some things I know not just by observing the outside world, like when chimpanzees learn to be afraid of skulls and snakes much faster than they learn to be afraid of other arbitrary shapes.  There are heuristics I'm born with, based on how my brain was wired, which ultimately stems from my DNA specifying the way that proteins should fold to form neurons -\n\nBlaine:  So, for purposes of following along with the argument, let's say that your DNA is analogous to the code of the computer program that makes predictions.  What you're observing here is that humans have 750 megabytes of DNA, and even if most of that is junk, it still leaves a pretty large computer program that could have a lot of prior information programmed into it.\n\nAshley:  Right.",

      "text": "Ashley:  So, you said you were going to tell me about... Solomon's induction?\n\nBlaine:  Solomonoff induction.  Goes back to the 1960s and the mathematician Ray Solomonoff.  The key idea in Solomonoff induction is to do sequence prediction by having a probability distribution over -\n\nAshley:  Wait.  Before you launch right into an explanation of what Solomonoff induction *is*, I'd like you to try to tell me what it *does*, or why people study it in the first place.  I find that helps me organize my listening.\n\nBlaine:  Um... okay.  Let me think for a second...\n\nAshley:  Also, while I can imagine things that \"sequence prediction\" might mean, I haven't actually encountered it in a technical context, so you'd better go a bit further back and start more at the beginning.  I do know what a probability distribution is.\n\nBlaine:  Okay.  So... one way of framing the usual reason why people study this sort of thing in the first place, is that sometimes, by studying what it would be possible to do with unlimited computing power, we can gain valuable intuitions about epistemology - that's, uh, the field that studies how to reason about factual questions, how to build a map of reality that reflects the territory...\n\nAshley:  I have some idea what 'epistemology' is, yes.  But I think you might need to start even further back, maybe with some sort of concrete example or something.\n\nBlaine:  Okay.  Um.  So one anecdote that I sometimes use to frame the value of computer science to the study of epistemology, is Edgar Allen Poe's argument in 1833 that chess was uncomputable.\n\nAshley:  That doesn't sound like a thing that actually happened.\n\nBlaine:  I know, but it totally *did* happen and not in a metaphorical sense either!  Edgar Allen Poe wrote an essay explaining why no automaton would ever be able to play chess, and he specifically mentioned \"Mr. Babbage's computing engine\" as an example.  You see, in the nineteenth century, there was for a time this sensation known as the Mechanical Turk - supposedly a machine, an automaton, that could play chess.  At the grandmaster level, no less.  Now today, when we're accustomed to the idea that a computer chip needs to be doing billions of operations per second to play chess, you or I know *immediately* that the Mechanical Turk must have been a fraud and that there must have been a concealed operator inside - a midget, as it turned out - especially when, if you reached out to upset one of the Turk's pieces, the Turk would reach back out and set it back up again, and if you kept on doing it, the Turk would refuse to play, and so on.  *Today* we know that this sort of thing is *hard* to build into a machine.  But in the 19th century, even that much wasn't known.  So when Edgar Allen Poe, who besides being an author was also an accomplished magician, set out to write an essay about the Mechanical Turk, he spent the *second* half of the essay dissecting what was known about the Turk's appearance to (correctly) figure out where the human operator was hiding.  But Poe spent the *first* half of the essay arguing that no automaton - nothing like Mr. Babbage's computing engine - could possibly play chess, which was how he knew *a priori* that the Turk had a concealed human operator.\n\nAshley:  And what was Poe's argument?\n\nBlaine:  Poe observed that in an algebraical problem, each step followed from the previous step of necessity, which was why the steps in solving an algebraical problem could be represented by the deterministic motions of gears in something like Mr. Babbage's computing engine.  But in a chess problem, Poe said, there are many possible chess moves, and no move follows with necessity from the position of the board; and even if you did select one move, the opponent's move would not follow with necessity, so you couldn't represent it with the determined motion of automatic gears.  Therefore, Poe said, whatever was operating the Mechanical Turk must have the nature of Cartesian mind, rather than the nature of deterministic matter, and this was knowable *a priori*.  And then he started figuring out where the required operator was hiding.\n\nAshley:  That's... actually really impressive reasoning, and completely wrong at the same time.\n\nBlaine:  I know!  Isn't it great?\n\nAshley:  I mean, that sounds like Poe correctly identified the *hard* part of playing computer chess - the branching factor of moves and countermoves - the reason why no *simple* machine could do it, and he just didn't realize that a deterministic machine could deterministically check many possible moves in order to figure out the game tree.  So close, and yet so far.\n\nBlaine:  More than a century later, in 1950, Claude Shannon published the first paper ever written on computer chess... and in passing, Shannon gave the formula for playing perfect chess if you had unlimited computing power, the algorithm you'd use to extrapolate the entire game tree.  We could say that Shannon gave a short program that would solve chess if you ran it on a hypercomputer, where a hypercomputer is an ideal computer that can run any finite computation immediately.  And *then* Shannon passed on to talking about the problem of locally guessing how good a board position was, so that you could play chess using only a *small* search.  I say all this to make a point about the value of knowing how to solve problems using hypercomputers, even though hypercomputers don't exist.  Yes, there's often a *huge* gap between the unbounded solution and the practical solution.  It wasn't until 1997, forty-seven years after Shannon's paper giving the unbounded solution, that Deep Blue actually won the world chess championship -\n\nAshley:  And that wasn't just a question of faster computing hardware running Shannon's ideal search algorithm.  There were a lot of new insights along the way, most notably the alpha-beta pruning algorithm and a lot of improvements in positional evaluation.\n\nBlaine:  Right!  But I think some people overreact to that forty-seven year gap, and act like it's *worthless* to have an unbounded understanding of a computer program, just because you might still be forty-seven years away from a practical solution.  But if you don't even have a solution that would run on a hyercomputer, you're Poe in 1833, not Shannon in 1950.  The reason I tell the anecdote about Poe is to illustrate that Poe was *confused* about computer chess in a way that Shannon was not.  When we don't know how to solve a problem even given infinite computing power, the very work we are trying to do is in some sense murky to us.  When we can state code that would solve the problem given a hypercomputer, we have become *less* confused.  Once we have the unbounded solution we understand, in some basic sense, *the kind of work we are trying to perform,* and then we can try to figure out how to do it *efficiently* -\n\nAshley:  Which may well require new insights into the structure of the problem, or even a conceptual revolution in how we imagine the work we're trying to do.\n\nBlaine:  Yes, but the point is that *you can't even get started on that* if you're arguing about how playing chess has the nature of Cartesian mind rather than matter, because deterministic gear motions can't represent non-determined chess moves.  At that point you're not 50 years away from winning the chess championship, you're 150 years away, because it took an extra 100 years to move humanity's understanding to the point where you could easily see how to play chess using a hypercomputer.  I'm not trying to exalt the unbounded solution by denigrating the work required to get a bounded solution, I'm not saying that when we have an unbounded solution we're practically there and the rest is a matter of mere lowly efficiency, I'm trying to compare having the unbounded solution to the horrific confusion of *not knowing what kind of work we're trying to do.*\n\nAshley:  Okay.  I think I understand why, on your view, it's important to know how to solve problems using infinitely fast computers, or hypercomputers as you call them; when we can say how to answer a question using infinite computing power, that means we crisply understand the question itself, in some sense, while if we can't figure out how to solve a problem using unbounded computing power, that means we're confused about the problem in some sense.  I can see that, yes.  I mean, if you've ever tried to teach the more doomed sort of undergraduate to write computer programs, you pick up a pretty clear sense of what it means to be confused about what it takes to compute something.  So what does this have to do with \"Solomonoff induction\"?\n\nBlaine:  Ah!  Well, suppose I asked you how to do epistemology using infinite computing power?\n\nAshley:  My good fellow, I would at once reply, \"Beep.  Whirr.  Problem 'do epistemology' not crisply specified.\"  At this stage of affairs, I do not think this reply indicates any fundamental confusion on my part; rather I think it is you who must be clearer.  And don't tell me that 'epistemology' means 'how we should reason in order to construct an accurate map of reality,' because that's still not crisply specified.\n\nBlaine:  Well, perhaps.  But even there I would suggest that it's a mark of intellectual progress to be able to take vague and underspecified ideas like 'do good epistemology' and turn them *into* crisply specified problems.  Imagine that I went up to my friend Cecil, and said, \"How would you do good epistemology given unlimited computing power and a short Python program?\" and Cecil at once came back with an answer, and it was actually a pretty reasonable and good answer once explained.  Cecil would probably know something quite interesting that you do not presently know - for one thing, the knowledge of *a good way to formalize* the problem of 'doing good epistemology' in the first place.\n\nAshley:  I confess to being rather skeptical of this hypothetical.  But if that actually happened - if I agreed, to my own satisfaction, that someone had stated a short Python program that would 'do good epistemology' if run on an unboundedly fast computer - then I agree that I'd probably have learned something *quite interesting* about epistemology.\n\nBlaine:  What Cecil knows about, in this hypothetical, is Solomonoff induction.  In the same way that Claude Shannon answered \"Given infinite computing power, how would you play perfect chess?\", Ray Solomonoff answered \"Given infinite computing power, how would you perfectly find the best hypothesis that fits the facts?\"\n\nAshley:  Suddenly, I find myself strongly suspicious of whatever you are about to say to me.\n\nBlaine:  That's understandable.\n\nAshley:  In particular, I'll ask at once whether \"Solomonoff induction\" assumes that our *hypotheses* are being given to us on a silver platter by the programmers along with the exact data we're supposed to explain, or whether the algorithm is organizing its own data from a big messy situation and *inventing* good hypotheses from scratch -\n\nBlaine:  Great question!  It's the second one.\n\nAshley:  Really?  Okay, now I have to ask whether Solomonoff induction is a recognized concept in good standing in the field of academic computer science, because that does not sound like something modern-day computer science knows how to do.\n\nBlaine:  I wouldn't say it's a widely known concept, but it's one that's in good academic standing.  I don't think any professor that knew about it would hesitate to teach it.  The method isn't used in modern machine learning because it requires an infinitely fast computer and isn't easily approximated the way that chess is.\n\nAshley:  This really sounds *very* suspicious.  Last time I checked, we hadn't *begun* to formalize the creation of good new hypotheses from scratch.  I've heard about claims to have 'automated' the work that, say, Newton did in inventing classical mechanics, and I've found them all to be incredibly dubious.  Which is to say, they were rigged demos and lies.\n\nBlaine:  I know, but -\n\nAshley:  And then I'm even more suspicious of a claim that someone's algorithm would solve this problem if only they had infinite computing power.  Having some researcher claim that their Good-Old-Fashioned AI semantic network *would* be intelligent if run on a computer so large that, conveniently, nobody can ever test their theory, is not going to persuade me.\n\nBlaine:  ...Do I really strike you as that much of a charlatan?  What have I ever done to you, that you would expect me to try pulling a scam like that?\n\nAshley:  That's fair.  I shouldn't accuse you of planning that scam when I haven't seen you say it.  But I'm pretty sure the problem of \"coming up with good new hypotheses in a world full of messy data\" is basically AI-complete, like, solving this problem means you have strong AI.  And I don't see how else you could claim that we have an algorithm for that given sufficiently large computers.  I mean, even Mentif-\n\nBlaine:  Do not say the name, or he will appear!\n\nAshley:  Sorry.  But even the legendary first and greatest of all AI crackpots, He-Who-Googles-His-Name, could assert that his algorithms would be all-powerful on a computer large enough to make his claim unfalsifiable.  So what?\n\nBlaine:  That's a very sensible reply given your current background knowledge and this, again, is *exactly* the kind of mental state that reflects a problem that is *confusing* rather than just *hard to implement.*  It's the sort of confusion Poe might feel in 1833, or close to it.  In other words, it's just the sort of conceptual issue we *would* have solved at the point where we could state a short program that could run on a hypercomputer.  Which Ray Solomonoff did in 1964.\n\nAshley:  Okay.  Fine.  Let's hear about this general solution to epistemology.\n\nBlaine:  First, try to solve the following puzzle.  1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29...?\n\nAshley:  Let me look at those for a moment... 47.\n\nBlaine:  Congratulations on engaging in, as we snooty types would call it, 'sequence prediction'.\n\nAshley:  I'm following you so far.\n\nBlaine:  The smarter you are, the more easily you can find the hidden patterns in sequences and predict them successfully. You had to notice the resemblance to the Fibonacci rule to guess the next number. Someone who didn't already know about Fibonacci, or who was worse at mathematical thinking, would have taken longer to understand the sequence or maybe never learned to predict it at all.\n\nAshley: Still with you.\n\nBlaine: It's not a sequence of *numbers* per se... but can you see how the question, \"The sun has risen on the last million days. What is the probability that it rises tomorrow?\" could be viewed as a kind of sequence prediction problem?\n\nAshley: Only if some programmer neatly parses up the world into a series of \"Did the Sun rise on day X starting in 4.5 billion BCE, 0 means no and 1 means yes?  1, 1, 1, 1, 1...\" and so on.  Which is exactly the sort of shenanigan that I see as cheating.\n\nBlaine:  I agree that's cheating.  But suppose I have a robot running around with a webcam showing it a 1920x1080 pixel field that refreshes 60 times a second with 32-bit colors.  I could view that as a giant sequence and ask the robot to predict what it will see happen when it rolls out to watch a sunrise the next day.\n\nAshley: I can't help but notice that the 'sequence' of webcam frames is absolutely enormous... oh, right, computers much bigger than the universe. And now you're smiling evilly, so I guess that's the point. I also notice that the sequence is no longer deterministically predictable, that it is no longer a purely mathematical object, and that the sequence of webcam frames observed will depend on the robot's choices. This makes me feel a bit shaky about the analogy to predicting the mathematical sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\nBlaine: I'll try to address those points in order. First, Solomonoff induction is about assigning *probabilities* to the next item in the sequence. I mean, if I showed you a box that said 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 you would not be absolutely certain that the next item would be 13. There could be some more complicated rule that just looked Fibonacci-ish but then diverged. You might guess with 90% probability but not 100% probability, or something like that.\n\nAshley: Didn't you say that Solomonoff was a mathematician?  Because this has stopped feeling like math.\n\nBlaine: There is a *large* branch of math, to say nothing of computer science, that deals in probabilities and statistical prediction.  We are going to be describing absolutely lawful and deterministic ways of assigning probabilities after seeing 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18.\n\nAshley:  Okay, but if you're later going to tell me that this lawful probabilistic prediction rule underlies a generally intelligent epistemological reasoner, I'm already skeptical.  No matter how large a computer it's run on, I find it hard to imagine that some simple set of rules for assigning probabilities is going to encompass truly and generally intelligent answers about sequence prediction, like Terence Tao would give after looking at the sequence for a while.  We just have no idea how Terence Tao works, so we can't duplicate his abilities in a formal rule, no matter how much computing power that rule gets... you're smiling evilly again.  I'll be *quite* interested if that evil smile turns out to be justified.\n\nBlaine:  Indeed.\n\nAshley: I also find it hard to imagine that this deterministic mathematical rule for assigning probabilities would notice if the box was outputting an ASCII-encoded version of Hamlet's speech in Shakespeare, which I would notice eventually though maybe not right away... and you're *still* smiling evilly.\n\nBlaine:  Indeed.  That is *exactly* what Solomonoff induction does.  Furthermore, we have theorems establishing that Solomonoff induction can do it way better than you or Terence Tao.\n\nAshley:  A *theorem* proves this.  As in a necessary mathematical truth.  Even though we have no idea how Terence Tao works empirically... and there's evil smile number four.  Okay.  I am *very* skeptical, but willing to be convinced.\n\nBlaine:  So if you actually did have a hypercomputer, you could *cheat*, right?  And Solomonoff induction is the most ridiculously cheating cheat in the history of cheating.\n\nAshley:  Go on.\n\nBlaine:  We just run all possible computer programs to see which are the simplest computer programs that best predict the data seen so far, and use those programs to predict what comes next.  This mixture contains, among other things, an exact copy of Terence Tao, thereby allowing us to prove theorems about their relative performance.\n\nAshley:  What.\n\nBlaine:  That's what the equation for Solomonoff induction says.\n\nAshley:  Is this an actual reputable math thing?  I mean really?\n\nBlaine:  Yes, it is.  I'll get to formalizing the math shortly, but you did ask me to first state the point of it all.  The point of Solomonoff induction is that it gives us a gold-standard ideal for sequence prediction, and this gold-standard prediction only errs by a bounded amount, over infinite time, relative to the best computable sequence predictor.  We can also see it as formalizing the intuitive idea that was expressed by William Ockham a few centuries earlier that simpler theories are more likely to be correct, and as telling us that 'simplicity' should be measured in algorithmic complexity, which is the size of a computer program required to output a hypothesis's predictions.\n\nAshley:  I think I would have to read more on this subject to actually follow that.  What I'm hearing is that Solomonoff induction is a reputable idea that is important because it gives us a kind of ideal for sequence prediction.  This ideal also has something to do with Occam's Razor and the idea that the simplest theory is the one that can be represented by the shortest computer program.  You identify this with \"doing good epistemology\".\n\nBlaine:  Yes, those are legitimate takeaways.  Another way of looking at it is that Solomonoff induction is an ideal but uncomputable answer to the question \"What should our priors be?\", which is left open by understanding Bayesian updating.\n\nAshley:  Can you say how Solomonoff induction answers the question of, say, the prior probability that Canada is planning to invade the United States?  To name one example of a thing I've seen being estimated ludicrously high on a crackpot website that actually tried to invoke Bayesian probability about it.  Does Solomonoff induction let me tell him that he's making a math error, instead of just calling him an idiot in an admittedly informal fashion?\n\nBlaine:  If you're expecting to sit down with Leibniz and say, \"Gentlemen, let us calculate\" then you're setting your expectations too high.  Solomonoff gives us an idea of how we *should* compute that quantity given *unlimited* computing power.  It *doesn't* give us a firm procedural recipe for how we can best approximate that ideal in real life using bounded computing power or human brains.  Knowing the ideal, we *can* extract some intuitive advice that might help our online crackpot if only he'd actually listen to it.\n\nAshley:  But according to you, Solomonoff induction does say in principle what is the prior probability that Canada will invade the United States.\n\nBlaine:  Yes, up to a choice of universal Turing machine.\n\nAshley *(looking highly skeptical):*  So I plug a universal Turing machine into the formalism, and in principle, I get out a uniquely determined probability that Canada invades the US.  No free variables left once I pick the UTM.\n\nBlaine:  Exactly.\n\nAshley:  Walk me through exactly how that works again?\n\nBlaine:  So, first, we have to transform this into a sequence prediction problem.\n\nAshley:  Like a sequence of years in which Canada has and hasn't invaded the US, mostly zero except around 1812 -\n\nBlaine:  *No!*  To get a good prediction about Canada we need much more data than that, and I don't mean a dump of Canadian GDP either.  Imagine a sequence that contains all the sensory data you have ever received over your lifetime - not just the hospital room that you saw when you opened your eyes right after your birth, but the darkness your brain received as input while you were still in your mother's womb.  Every word you've ever heard.  Every letter you've ever seen on a computer screen, not as ASCII letters but as the raw pattern of neural impulses that gets sent down from your retina.  And also in this sequence is every nerve impulse you've ever sent to your muscles, every motion of your fingers, every breath your brain orders your lungs to draw in.\n\nAshley:  That seems like a lot of data and some of it is redundant, there'll be lots of similar pixels for blue sky -\n\nBlaine:  That data is what *you* got as an agent.  Like, that data is the Sequence of the Ashley-Agent.\n\nAshley:  Is that a technical term I should know, or -\n\nBlaine:  No, I was trying to be metaphorical.  What I'm saying is, if we want to translate the question of the prediction problem Ashley faces into theoretical terms, we should give the sequence predictor *all* the data that you had available, including all those repeating blue pixels of the sky.  Who knows?  Maybe there was a Canadian warplane in there that you didn't notice.\n\nAshley:  I think I'm with you so far.  But why does your sequence include my actions?  Aren't those my outputs, not my inputs?  My finger motions don't happen to me as sensory data, I decide them and output them myself -\n\nBlaine:  Solomonoff induction in the original formalism is about sequence prediction, a problem that doesn't include actions.  \n\n# (in progress)\n\nAshley:  If your sequence is trying to include *all* the data I have, it seems incomplete.  There are some things I know not just by observing the outside world, like when chimpanzees learn to be afraid of skulls and snakes much faster than they learn to be afraid of other arbitrary shapes.  There are heuristics I'm born with, based on how my brain was wired, which ultimately stems from my DNA specifying the way that proteins should fold to form neurons -\n\nBlaine:  So, for purposes of following along with the argument, let's say that your DNA is analogous to the code of the computer program that makes predictions.  What you're observing here is that humans have 750 megabytes of DNA, and even if most of that is junk, it still leaves a pretty large computer program that could have a lot of prior information programmed into it.\n\nAshley:  Right.",
