      "text": "\"Saving the phenomena\" is the name for the rule that brilliant new scientific theories still need to reproduce our mundane old observations.  The point of heliocentric astronomy is not to predict that the Sun careens crazily over the sky, but rather, to explain why the Sun appears to rise and set each day - the same old mundane observations we had already.  Similarly quantum mechanics is not supposed to add up to a weird universe unlike the one we observe; it is supposed to add up to normality.  New theories may have not-previously-predicted observational consequences in places we haven't looked yet, but by *default* we expect the sky to look the same color.\n\n\"Rescuing the utility function\" is an analogous normative principle meant to apply to naturalistic moral philosophy: new theories about which things are composed of which other things should, by default, not affect what we value.  For example, if your values previously made mention of \"moral responsibility\" or \"subjective experience\", you should go on valuing these things after discovering that people are made of parts.\n\nAs the above sentence contains the word \"should\", the principle of \"rescuing the utility function\" is being asserted as [3y9 a normative principle rather than a descriptive theory].\n\n# Metaphorical example: heat and kinetic energy\n\nSuppose, metaphorically speaking, that our species that regarded \"warmth\" as a [1bh terminal] value about the environment - rather than it being nice to feel warm in a warm coat, you preferred that the outside world be warm, in the same way that e.g. you prefer for your friends to actually be happy in the outside world, and would not be satisfied to only deceive yourself into thinking your friends were happy.\n\nOne day, scientists propose that \"heat\" may really be composed of \"disordered kinetic energy\" - that when we experience an object as warmer, it's because the particles comprising that object are vibrating and bumping into each other at a higher speed.  You imagine this in your mind, but find that you don't get any sense of lovely warmth out of imagining lots of objects moving around.  No matter how fast you imagine an object vibrating, this imagination doesn't seem to produce a corresponding imagined feeling of lovely warmth.  You therefore reject the idea that warmth is composed of disordered kinetic motion.\n\nAfter this, science advances a bit further and *proves* that heat is composed of disordered kinetic energy.\n\nOne possible way to react to this revelation - again, assuming for the sake of argument that you cared about warmth as a [1bh terminal value] - would be by experiencing great existential horror.  Science has proven that the universe is devoid of ontologically basic heat!  There's really no such thing as heat!  It's all just cold particles moving around - worse, particles which in an individual sense aren't even cold!\n\nSure, if you dip your finger in hot water, it *feels* warm.  But neuroscientists have shown that when our nerves tell us there's heat, they're really just being fooled into firing by being excited with kinetic energy.  When we touch an object and it feels hot, this is just an illusion being produced by fast-moving particles activating our nerves.  This is why our brains make us think that things are hot even though they're just bouncing particles.  Very sad, but at least now we know the truth.\n\nAlternatively, you could react as follows:\n\n- Heat doesn't have to be ontologically basic to be valuable.  Valuable things can be made out of parts.\n- The parts that heat was made out of, turn out to be disordered kinetic energy.  Heat isn't an illusion, vibrating particles just *are* heat.  It's not like you're getting a consolation prize of vibrating particles when you really wanted heat.  You *have* heat.  It's *right there* in the warm water.\n- From now on, you'll think of warmth when you think of disordered kinetic energy and vibrating particles.  Since your native emotions don't automatically light up when you use the vibrating-particles visualization of heat, you will now adopt the rule that whenever you *imagine* disordered kinetic energy being present, you will *imagine* a sensation of warmth so as to go on binding your emotions to this new model of reality.\n\nThis reply would be what we call \"rescuing the utility function\".\n\n## Argument for rescuing the utility function (in the metaphor)\n\nOur minds have an innate and instinctive representation of the universe to which our emotions natively and automatically bind.  Warmth (and color, and happiness...) are basic *to that representation*; we don't instinctive imagine them as made out of parts.  When we imagine warmth in our native model, our emotions automatically bind and give us the imagined feeling of warmth.\n\nAfter learning more about how the universe works and how to imagine more abstract and non-native concepts, we can also visualize a lower-level model of the universe containing vibrating particles.  But unsurprisingly, our emotions only automatically bind to our native, built-in mental models and not the derived or abstract models of our universe's physics.  So if you imagine tiny billiard balls whizzing about, it's no surprise that this mental picture doesn't automatically trigger warm feelings.\n\nIt's a [3y9 descriptive] statement about our universe, a way the universe *is*, that 'heat' is a high-level representation of the disordered kinetic energy of colliding and vibrating particles.  But to advocate that we should re-bind our emotions to this non-native mental model by *feeling cold* or *devoid of heat* is to advocate one possible [3y9 normative] statement among many - it says that we *should* only feel warmth about universes that have ontologically basic heat that can directly correspond to our native mental representation of heat.\n\nSaying \"There *is* really no such thing as heat!\" is from this perspective [3y9 a normative statement rather than a descriptive one].  The real meaning is \"If you're in a universe where the observed phenomenon of heat turns out to be comprised of vibrating particles, then you *shouldn't* feel any warmth-related emotions about that universe.\"  Or, \"Only ontologically basic heat can be valuable.\"  Or, \"If you've only previously considered questions of value over your native representation, and that's the only representation to which your emotions natively bind, then you should attach a constant zero value to every discoverable physical universe which doesn't exactly match that representation.\"  This normative proposition is a different statement than the descriptive truth, \"Our universe contains no ontologically basic heat.\"\n\nThe program of \"rescuing the utility function\" advocates that we have no right to expect the universe to function exactly like our native representation of it.  According to this viewpoint, it would be a strange and silly demand to make of the universe that its lowest level of operation correspond exactly to our built-in mental representations, and try to hold it hostage by insisting that we're not going to *feel* anything warm about reality unless heat is basic to physics.\n\nWe were bound to eventually discover that heat was made of *something* that was in turn made out of math.  The high-level representations our emotions natively bind to, could not possibly have been fated to be identical with the raw low-level description of the universe.  So if we couldn't 'rescue the utility function' by identifying high-level heat with vibrating particles, this term of our utility function would *inevitably* end in disappointment.\n\nThus, once we can see as normative the question of how to feel about a universe that has dancing particles instead of ontologically basic warmth, we can see that going around wailing in existential despair about the coldness of the universe doesn't seem like the right act or the right judgment.  We should rebind our native emotions to the non-native but more accurate model of the universe, not judge that our utility function must inevitably turn out to be zero everywhere.\n\nIf we aren't self-modifying AIs and can't actually rewrite our emotions that easily, then we can come *closer* to normative reasoning by visualizing warmth whenever we visualize whizzing particles.\n\nOn this stance, it is not a *lie* to visualize warmth when we visualize whizzing particles.  We are not giving ourselves a sad consolation prize for the absence of 'real' heat.  It's not an act of self-deception to imagine a sensation of lovely warmth going along with a bunch of individually temperature-less particles vibrating quickly.  That's just what heat *is* in our universe.  Our nerves are not lying to us when they make us feel that fast-vibrating water is warm water.\n\nOn the normative principle of \"rescuing the utility function\", when X turns out to be comprised of Y, then by default we should feel about Y the same way we felt about X.  There might be other considerations that modify this, but that's the starting point or default.\n\nAfter 'rescuing the utility function', your new theory of how the universe operates (that heat is made up of kinetic energy) adds up to *moral normality.*  If you previously thought that a warm summer was better than a cold winter, you will still think that a warm summer is better than a cold winter after you find out what heat is made out of.\n\n(This is a good thing, since the point of a moral philosophy is not to be amazing and counterintuitive.)\n\n## Reason for using the heat metaphor\n\nThe reason to start from this metaphorical example is that \"heat\" has a relatively understandable correspondence between high-level and low-level models.  On a high level, we can see heat melting ice and flowing from hotter objects to cooler objects.  We can, by imagination, see how vibrating particles could actually constitute heat rather than causing a mysterious extra 'heat' property to be present.  Vibrations might flow from fast-vibrating objects to slow-vibrating objects via the particles bumping into each other and transmitting their speed.  Water molecules vibrating quickly enough in an ice cube might break whatever bonds were holding them together in a solid object.\n\nSince it does happen to be relatively easy to visualize how heat is composed of kinetic energy, we can *see* in this case that we are not lying to ourselves by imagining that lovely warmth is present wherever vibrating particles are present.\n\n(For an even more transparent identity, consider, \"You're not *really* wearing socks, there *are* no socks, there's only a bunch of threads woven together that *looks* like a sock.\"  Your visual cortex can represent this identity directly, so it feels immediately transparent that the sock just *is* the collection of threads; when you visualize sock-shaped woven threads, you automatically feel yourself to be recognizing a sock.  (Apologies to any readers who can't visually imagine a sock and will need to look at a real sock instead.))\n\nIf the relation between heat and kinetic energy were too complicated to visualize easily, it might instead feel like we were being given a blind, unjustified rule that reality contains mysterious 'bridging laws' that make a separate quality of heat be present when particles vibrate quickly.  Visualizing \"warmth\" as present when particles vibrate quickly would feel more like fooling ourselves, or self-deception.  But on the position of \"rescuing the same utility function\", the same arguments ought to apply here as well, even if they feel less obvious.\n\nThe gap between mind and brain is larger than the gap between heat and vibration, which is why humanity understood heat as disordered kinetic energy long before anyone had any idea [38r how 'playing chess' could be decomposed into non-mental simpler parts].  In some cases, we may not even *know* what the identity will be.  Still, the advice of \"rescuing the utility function\" is not to panic in advance about realizing that various emotionally valent things will turn out to be made of parts.\n\n## Complex rescues\n\nIn the heat metaphor, the lower level of the universe (jiggling particles) corresponds fairly exactly to the high-level notion of heat.  We'd run into more complicated questions if we'd previously lumped together the 'heat' of chili peppers and the 'heat' of a fireplace as valuable 'warmth'.  We might end up saying that there are two kinds of valuable warm things (by the default rule, if X is made of Y then Y inherits X's role in the utility function); alternatively, by some non-default line of reasoning, the discovery that chili peppers and fireplaces are warm in ontologically different ways might lead us to change how we feel about them on a high level as well.  In this case we might have to carry out a more complicated rescue, where it's not so immediately obvious which low-level Ys are to inherit X's value.\n\n# Non-metaphorical cases of rescuable utility\n\nWe don't actually have [1bh terminal values] for things being warm (at least I don't think I do).  Non-metaphorically, \"rescuing the utility function\" says that we should apply similar reasoning to phenomena that we do in fact value, whose value we are having trouble reconciling with a universe made of simpler parts.\n\nExamples might include:\n\n- Moral responsibility.  How can we hold anyone responsible for their actions, or even hold ourselves responsible for what we see as our own choices, when our acts have causal histories behind them?\n- Happiness.  What's the point of people being happy if it's just neurons firing?\n- Goodness and shouldness.  Can there be any right thing to do, if there isn't an ontologically basic irreducible rightness property to correspond to our sense that some things are just right?\n- Wanting and helping.  When a person wants different things at different times, and there are known experiments that expose circular and incoherent preferences, how can we possibly 'help' anyone by 'giving them what they want' or '[313 extrapolating their volition]'?\n\nIt may even be that our native representation is in some sense running skew to the real universe - e.g., our minds insist that something called 'free will' is very important to moral responsibility, but it seems impossible to define 'free will' in a coherent way.  Even in this case, the position of \"rescuing the utility function\" takes the stance of \"Okay, let's figure out how to map this emotion onto a coherent universe as best we can\" not \"Well, it looks like the human brain didn't start out with a perfect representation of reality, therefore, normatively speaking, we should toss the corresponding emotions out the window.\"  If in your native representation the Sun goes around the Earth, and then we learn differently from astronomy, we re-bind to the enormous glowing fusion reactor rather than saying that there's no Sun.\n\n# Circularity, aka self-consistency\n\nSince human beings don't *have* utility functions or consistent preferences, the notion of \"rescuing the utility function\" is itself a matter of rescue.  Natively, it's possible for psychology experiments to expose inconsistent preferences, but instead of throwing up our hands and saying \"Well I guess nobody wants anything and we might as well turn the universe into paperclips!\", we'll try to back out some reasonably coherent preferences (aka utility functions) from the mess; which is, arguendo, normatively better than throwing up our hands and turning the universe into paperclips.\n\nSimilarly, according to [313 the normative stance behind extrapolated volition], the very notion of *shouldness* is something that gets rescued.  Many people seem to want 'shouldness' to be an ontologically basic, irreducible property of rightness, such that every cognitively powerful agent with factual knowledge about this property is thereby compelled to perform the corresponding actions.  (\"Moral internalism.\")  But this is demanding an overly direct correspondence between our native sense that some acts have a compelling rightness quality about them, and wanting there to be an ontologically basic compelling rightness quality out there in the environment.\n\nIt isn't even fair to say that humans *natively* want or *naturally* demand that this is what our sense of rightness correspond to.  A hunter-gatherer, say, or a perfectly normal person who's never debated metaethics, doesn't have any commitments about whether a feeling of rightness is only possibly allowed to correspond to universes that have irreducible rightness properties in them.  If you'd grown up thinking that your feeling of rightness of course [313 corresponded to computing a certain logical function over universes] rather than an irreducible causal property of the universe, this would seem perfectly natural and not at all disappointing.\n\nThis means that in the case of extrapolated volition as a normative theory, the rescue project is saying that we *should* construe the notion of 'shouldness' to draw a correspondence between our feelings of rightness, and a logical function over universes that our minds can be said to be computing when they compute whether to feel that way.\n\nThis could of course be termed circular, but we could equally say that it is self-consistent.  A human child doesn't start out by endorsing any particular way of cashing out their feeling of rightness into a set of philosophical rules about utility functions and why they should or shouldn't be rescued.  As humans, we start out with no clear rules inside the chaos of our minds, and we have to make them up by considering various arguments appealing to our not-yet-organized intuitions, and only then can we even try to have coherent metaethical principles.  The core argument for \"rescuing the utility function\" is a base intuitive appeal that says, before you've picked out rules, that it isn't especially sensible to end up as the kind of agent whose utility function ends up being zero everywhere, or whose utility function ends up entirely unrelated to their emotions or sense of what's right.\n\nIn other words, rather than the rescue project needing to appeal to rules that would only be appealing to somebody who'd already accepted the rescue project ab initio, the start of the argument is an intuitive appeal to the pre-rules-adopting state of mind; and then past this point, we also (hopefully) find that these new rules are self-consistent.",

      "text": "\"Saving the phenomena\" is the name for the rule that brilliant new scientific theories still need to reproduce our mundane old observations.  The point of heliocentric astronomy is not to predict that the Sun careens crazily over the sky, but rather, to explain why the Sun appears to rise and set each day - the same old mundane observations we had already.  Similarly quantum mechanics is not supposed to add up to a weird universe unlike the one we observe; it is supposed to add up to normality.  New theories may have not-previously-predicted observational consequences in places we haven't looked yet, but by *default* we expect the sky to look the same color.\n\n\"Rescuing the utility function\" is an analogous normative principle meant to apply to naturalistic moral philosophy: new theories about which things are composed of which other things should, by default, not affect what we value.  For example, if your values previously made mention of \"moral responsibility\" or \"subjective experience\", you should go on valuing these things after discovering that people are made of parts.\n\nAs the above sentence contains the word \"should\", the principle of \"rescuing the utility function\" is being asserted as [3y9 a normative principle rather than a descriptive theory].\n\n# Metaphorical example: heat and kinetic energy\n\nSuppose, metaphorically speaking, that our species that regarded \"warmth\" as a [1bh terminal] value about the environment - rather than it being nice to feel warm in a warm coat, you preferred that the outside world be warm, in the same way that e.g. you prefer for your friends to actually be happy in the outside world, and would not be satisfied to only deceive yourself into thinking your friends were happy.\n\nOne day, scientists propose that \"heat\" may really be composed of \"disordered kinetic energy\" - that when we experience an object as warmer, it's because the particles comprising that object are vibrating and bumping into each other at a higher speed.  You imagine this in your mind, but find that you don't get any sense of lovely warmth out of imagining lots of objects moving around.  No matter how fast you imagine an object vibrating, this imagination doesn't seem to produce a corresponding imagined feeling of lovely warmth.  You therefore reject the idea that warmth is composed of disordered kinetic motion.\n\nAfter this, science advances a bit further and *proves* that heat is composed of disordered kinetic energy.\n\nOne possible way to react to this revelation - again, assuming for the sake of argument that you cared about warmth as a [1bh terminal value] - would be by experiencing great existential horror.  Science has proven that the universe is devoid of ontologically basic heat!  There's really no such thing as heat!  It's all just cold particles moving around - worse, particles which in an individual sense aren't even cold!\n\nSure, if you dip your finger in hot water, it *feels* warm.  But neuroscientists have shown that when our nerves tell us there's heat, they're really just being fooled into firing by being excited with kinetic energy.  When we touch an object and it feels hot, this is just an illusion being produced by fast-moving particles activating our nerves.  This is why our brains make us think that things are hot even though they're just bouncing particles.  Very sad, but at least now we know the truth.\n\nAlternatively, you could react as follows:\n\n- Heat doesn't have to be ontologically basic to be valuable.  Valuable things can be made out of parts.\n- The parts that heat was made out of, turn out to be disordered kinetic energy.  Heat isn't an illusion, vibrating particles just *are* heat.  It's not like you're getting a consolation prize of vibrating particles when you really wanted heat.  You *have* heat.  It's *right there* in the warm water.\n- From now on, you'll think of warmth when you think of disordered kinetic energy and vibrating particles.  Since your native emotions don't automatically light up when you use the vibrating-particles visualization of heat, you will now adopt the rule that whenever you *imagine* disordered kinetic energy being present, you will *imagine* a sensation of warmth so as to go on binding your emotions to this new model of reality.\n\nThis reply would be what we call \"rescuing the utility function\".\n\n## Argument for rescuing the utility function (in the metaphor)\n\nOur minds have an innate and instinctive representation of the universe to which our emotions natively and automatically bind.  Warmth (and color, and happiness...) are basic *to that representation*; we don't instinctive imagine them as made out of parts.  When we imagine warmth in our native model, our emotions automatically bind and give us the imagined feeling of warmth.\n\nAfter learning more about how the universe works and how to imagine more abstract and non-native concepts, we can also visualize a lower-level model of the universe containing vibrating particles.  But unsurprisingly, our emotions only automatically bind to our native, built-in mental models and not the derived or abstract models of our universe's physics.  So if you imagine tiny billiard balls whizzing about, it's no surprise that this mental picture doesn't automatically trigger warm feelings.\n\nIt's a [3y9 descriptive] statement about our universe, a way the universe *is*, that 'heat' is a high-level representation of the disordered kinetic energy of colliding and vibrating particles.  But to advocate that we should re-bind our emotions to this non-native mental model by *feeling cold* or *devoid of heat* is to advocate one possible [3y9 normative] statement among many - it says that we *should* only feel warmth about universes that have ontologically basic heat that can directly correspond to our native mental representation of heat.\n\nSaying \"There *is* really no such thing as heat!\" is from this perspective [3y9 a normative statement rather than a descriptive one].  The real meaning is \"If you're in a universe where the observed phenomenon of heat turns out to be comprised of vibrating particles, then you *shouldn't* feel any warmth-related emotions about that universe.\"  Or, \"Only ontologically basic heat can be valuable.\"  Or, \"If you've only previously considered questions of value over your native representation, and that's the only representation to which your emotions natively bind, then you should attach a constant zero value to every discoverable physical universe which doesn't exactly match that representation.\"  This normative proposition is a different statement than the descriptive truth, \"Our universe contains no ontologically basic heat.\"\n\nThe program of \"rescuing the utility function\" advocates that we have no right to expect the universe to function exactly like our native representation of it.  According to this viewpoint, it would be a strange and silly demand to make of the universe that its lowest level of operation correspond exactly to our built-in mental representations, and try to hold it hostage by insisting that we're not going to *feel* anything warm about reality unless heat is basic to physics.\n\nWe were bound to eventually discover that heat was made of *something* that was in turn made out of math.  The high-level representations our emotions natively bind to, could not possibly have been fated to be identical with the raw low-level description of the universe.  So if we couldn't 'rescue the utility function' by identifying high-level heat with vibrating particles, this term of our utility function would *inevitably* end in disappointment.\n\nThus, once we can see as normative the question of how to feel about a universe that has dancing particles instead of ontologically basic warmth, we can see that going around wailing in existential despair about the coldness of the universe doesn't seem like the right act or the right judgment.  We should rebind our native emotions to the non-native but more accurate model of the universe, not judge that our utility function must inevitably turn out to be zero everywhere.\n\nIf we aren't self-modifying AIs and can't actually rewrite our emotions that easily, then we can come *closer* to normative reasoning by visualizing warmth whenever we visualize whizzing particles.\n\nOn this stance, it is not a *lie* to visualize warmth when we visualize whizzing particles.  We are not giving ourselves a sad consolation prize for the absence of 'real' heat.  It's not an act of self-deception to imagine a sensation of lovely warmth going along with a bunch of individually temperature-less particles vibrating quickly.  That's just what heat *is* in our universe.  Our nerves are not lying to us when they make us feel that fast-vibrating water is warm water.\n\nOn the normative principle of \"rescuing the utility function\", when X turns out to be comprised of Y, then by default we should feel about Y the same way we felt about X.  There might be other considerations that modify this, but that's the starting point or default.\n\nAfter 'rescuing the utility function', your new theory of how the universe operates (that heat is made up of kinetic energy) adds up to *moral normality.*  If you previously thought that a warm summer was better than a cold winter, you will still think that a warm summer is better than a cold winter after you find out what heat is made out of.\n\n(This is a good thing, since the point of a moral philosophy is not to be amazing and counterintuitive.)\n\n## Reason for using the heat metaphor\n\nThe reason to start from this metaphorical example is that \"heat\" has a relatively understandable correspondence between high-level and low-level models.  On a high level, we can see heat melting ice and flowing from hotter objects to cooler objects.  We can, by imagination, see how vibrating particles could actually constitute heat rather than causing a mysterious extra 'heat' property to be present.  Vibrations might flow from fast-vibrating objects to slow-vibrating objects via the particles bumping into each other and transmitting their speed.  Water molecules vibrating quickly enough in an ice cube might break whatever bonds were holding them together in a solid object.\n\nSince it does happen to be relatively easy to visualize how heat is composed of kinetic energy, we can *see* in this case that we are not lying to ourselves by imagining that lovely warmth is present wherever vibrating particles are present.\n\n(For an even more transparent identity, consider, \"You're not *really* wearing socks, there *are* no socks, there's only a bunch of threads woven together that *looks* like a sock.\"  Your visual cortex can represent this identity directly, so it feels immediately transparent that the sock just *is* the collection of threads; when you visualize sock-shaped woven threads, you automatically feel yourself to be recognizing a sock.  (Apologies to any readers who can't visually imagine a sock and will need to look at a real sock instead.))\n\nIf the relation between heat and kinetic energy were too complicated to visualize easily, it might instead feel like we were being given a blind, unjustified rule that reality contains mysterious 'bridging laws' that make a separate quality of heat be present when particles vibrate quickly.  Visualizing \"warmth\" as present when particles vibrate quickly would feel more like fooling ourselves, or self-deception.  But on the position of \"rescuing the same utility function\", the same arguments ought to apply here as well, even if they feel less obvious.\n\nThe gap between mind and brain is larger than the gap between heat and vibration, which is why humanity understood heat as disordered kinetic energy long before anyone had any idea [38r how 'playing chess' could be decomposed into non-mental simpler parts].  In some cases, we may not even *know* what the identity will be.  Still, the advice of \"rescuing the utility function\" is not to panic in advance about realizing that various emotionally valent things will turn out to be made of parts.\n\n## Complex rescues\n\nIn the heat metaphor, the lower level of the universe (jiggling particles) corresponds fairly exactly to the high-level notion of heat.  We'd run into more complicated questions if we'd previously lumped together the 'heat' of chili peppers and the 'heat' of a fireplace as valuable 'warmth'.  We might end up saying that there are two kinds of valuable warm things (by the default rule, if X is made of Y then Y inherits X's role in the utility function); alternatively, by some non-default line of reasoning, the discovery that chili peppers and fireplaces are warm in ontologically different ways might lead us to change how we feel about them on a high level as well.  In this case we might have to carry out a more complicated rescue, where it's not so immediately obvious which low-level Ys are to inherit X's value.\n\n# Non-metaphorical cases of rescuable utility\n\nWe don't actually have [1bh terminal values] for things being warm (at least I don't think I do).  Non-metaphorically, \"rescuing the utility function\" says that we should apply similar reasoning to phenomena that we do in fact value, whose value we are having trouble reconciling with a universe made of simpler parts.\n\nExamples might include:\n\n- Moral responsibility.  How can we hold anyone responsible for their actions, or even hold ourselves responsible for what we see as our own choices, when our acts have causal histories behind them?\n- Happiness.  What's the point of people being happy if it's just neurons firing?\n- Goodness and shouldness.  Can there be any right thing to do, if there isn't an ontologically basic irreducible rightness property to correspond to our sense that some things are just right?\n- Wanting and helping.  When a person wants different things at different times, and there are known experiments that expose circular and incoherent preferences, how can we possibly 'help' anyone by 'giving them what they want' or '[313 extrapolating their volition]'?\n\nIt may even be that our native representation is in some sense running skew to the real universe - e.g., our minds insist that something called 'free will' is very important to moral responsibility, but it seems impossible to define 'free will' in a coherent way.  Even in this case, the position of \"rescuing the utility function\" takes the stance of \"Okay, let's figure out how to map this emotion onto a coherent universe as best we can\" not \"Well, it looks like the human brain didn't start out with a perfect representation of reality, therefore, normatively speaking, we should toss the corresponding emotions out the window.\"  If in your native representation the Sun goes around the Earth, and then we learn differently from astronomy, we re-bind to the enormous glowing fusion reactor rather than saying that there's no Sun.\n\n# Circularity, aka self-consistency\n\nSince human beings don't *have* utility functions or consistent preferences, the notion of \"rescuing the utility function\" is itself a matter of rescue.  Natively, it's possible for psychology experiments to expose inconsistent preferences, but instead of throwing up our hands and saying \"Well I guess nobody wants anything and we might as well turn the universe into paperclips!\", we'll try to back out some reasonably coherent preferences (aka utility functions) from the mess; which is, arguendo, normatively better than throwing up our hands and turning the universe into paperclips.\n\nSimilarly, according to [313 the normative stance behind extrapolated volition], the very notion of *shouldness* is something that gets rescued.  Many people seem to want 'shouldness' to be an ontologically basic, irreducible property of rightness, such that every cognitively powerful agent with factual knowledge about this property is thereby compelled to perform the corresponding actions.  (\"Moral internalism.\")  But this is demanding an overly direct correspondence between our native sense that some acts have a compelling rightness quality about them, and wanting there to be an ontologically basic compelling rightness quality out there in the environment.\n\nIt isn't even fair to say that humans *natively* want or *naturally* demand that this is what our sense of rightness correspond to.  A hunter-gatherer, say, or a perfectly normal person who's never debated metaethics, doesn't have any commitments about whether a feeling of rightness is only possibly allowed to correspond to universes that have irreducible rightness properties in them.  If you'd grown up thinking that your feeling of rightness of course [313 corresponded to computing a certain logical function over universes] rather than an irreducible causal property of the universe, this would seem perfectly natural and not at all disappointing.\n\nThis means that in the case of extrapolated volition as a normative theory, the rescue project is saying that we *should* construe the notion of 'shouldness' to draw a correspondence between our feelings of rightness, and a logical function over universes that our minds can be said to be computing when they compute whether to feel that way.\n\nThis could of course be termed circular, but we could equally say that it is self-consistent.  A human child doesn't start out by endorsing any particular way of cashing out their feeling of rightness into a set of philosophical rules about utility functions and why they should or shouldn't be rescued.  As humans, we start out with no clear rules inside the chaos of our minds, and we have to make them up by considering various arguments appealing to our not-yet-organized intuitions, and only then can we even try to have coherent metaethical principles.  The core argument for \"rescuing the utility function\" is a base intuitive appeal that says, before you've picked out rules, that it isn't especially sensible to end up as the kind of agent whose utility function ends up being zero everywhere, or whose utility function ends up entirely unrelated to their emotions or sense of what's right.\n\nIn other words, rather than the rescue project needing to appeal to rules that would only be appealing to somebody who'd already accepted the rescue project ab initio, the start of the argument is an intuitive appeal to the pre-rules-adopting state of mind; and then past this point, we also (hopefully) find that these new rules are self-consistent.",
