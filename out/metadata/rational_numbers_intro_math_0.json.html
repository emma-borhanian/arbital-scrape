  text: '[summary: The rational numbers are &quot;fractions&quot;. While the [45h natural numbers] measure the answer to the question &quot;how many apples?&quot; when we have some apples, the rationals measure the answer to the question &quot;how much apple?&quot; when we can cut the apples up in different ways and remove pieces before counting them. ]\n\n*In order to get the most out of this page, you probably want a good grasp of the [53r integers] first.*\n\n&quot;Rational number&quot; is a phrase mathematicians use for the idea of a &quot;fraction&quot;.\nHere, we&#39;ll go through what a fraction is and why we should care about them.\n\n# What is a fraction?\n\nSo far, we&#39;ve met the [48l integers]: whole numbers, which can be either bigger than $0$ or less than $0$ (or the very special $0$ itself).\nThe [45h natural numbers] can count the number of cows I have in my possession; the integers can also count the number of cows I have after I&#39;ve given away cows from having nothing, resulting in anti-cows.\n\nIn this article, though, we&#39;ll stop talking about cows and start talking about apples instead. The reason will become clear in a moment.\n\nSuppose I have two apples. %%note:I&#39;m terrible at drawing, so my apples look suspiciously like circles.%%\n\n![Two apples](http://i.imgur.com/ZqYDkEX.png)\n\nWhat if I chopped one of the apples into two equally-sized pieces? (And now you know why we stopped talking about cows.)\n\nNow what I have is a whole apple, andâ€¦ another apple which is in two pieces.\n\n![Two apples, one halved](http://i.imgur.com/pdUyIQe.png)\n\nLet&#39;s imagine now that I chop one of the pieces itself into two pieces, and for good measure I chop my remaining whole apple into three pieces.\n\n![Two apples, formed as two quarters, one half, three thirds](http://i.imgur.com/Zv1Y7EP.png)\n\nI still have the same amount of apple as I started with - I haven&#39;t eaten any of the pieces or anything - but now it&#39;s all in funny-sized chunks.\n\nNow I&#39;ll eat one of the smallest chunks. How many apples do I have now?\n\n![Two apples, with a quarter eaten from one](http://i.imgur.com/Bh0ekJQ.png)\n\nI certainly don&#39;t just have one apple, because three of the chunks I&#39;ve got in front of me will together make an apple; and I&#39;ve also got some chunks left over once I&#39;ve done that.\nBut I can&#39;t have two apples either, because I *started* with two and then I ate a bit.\nMathematicians like to be able to compare things, and if I forced you to make a comparison, you could say that I have &quot;more than one apple&quot; but &quot;fewer than two apples&quot;.\n\nIf you&#39;re happy with that, then it&#39;s a reasonable thing to ask: &quot;exactly how much apple do I have?&quot;.\nAnd the mathematician will give an answer of &quot;one apple and three quarters&quot;.\n&quot;One and three quarters&quot; is an example of a **rational number** or **fraction**: it expresses a quantity that came from dividing some number of things into some number of equal parts, then possibly removing some of the parts.\n%%note:I&#39;ve left out the point that just as you moved from the [45h counting numbers] to the [48l integers], thereby allowing you to owe someone some apples, so we can also have a negative rational number of apples. We&#39;ll get to that in time.%%\n\n# The basic building block\n\nFrom a certain point of view, the building block of the *natural* numbers is just the number $1$: all natural numbers can be made by just adding together the number $1$ some number of times. (If I have a heap of apples, I can build it up just from single apples.)\nThe building block of the integers is also the number $1$, because if you gave me some apples %%note:which perhaps I&#39;ve now eaten%% so that I owe you some apples, you might as well have given them to me one by one.\n\nNow the *rationals* have building blocks too, but this time there are lots and lots of them, because if you give me any kind of &quot;building block&quot; - some quantity of apple - I can always just chop it into two pieces and make a smaller &quot;building block&quot;.\n(This wasn&#39;t true when we were confined just to whole apples, as in the natural numbers! If I can&#39;t divide up an apple, then I can&#39;t make any quantity of apples smaller than one apple. %%note:Except no apples at all.%%)\n\nIt turns out that a good choice of building blocks is &quot;one piece, when we divide an apple into several equally-sized pieces&quot;.\nIf we took our apple, and divided it into five equal pieces, then the corresponding building-block is &quot;one fifth of an apple&quot;: five of these building blocks makes one apple.\nTo a mathematician, we have just made the rational number which is written $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nSimilarly, if we divided our apple instead into six equal pieces, and take just one of the pieces, then we have made the rational number which is written $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nThe (positive) rational numbers are just whatever we could make by taking lots of copies of building blocks.\n\n# Examples\n\n- $1$ is a rational number. It can be made with the building block that is just $1$ itself, which is what we get if we take an apple and divide it into just one piece - that is, making no cuts at all. Or, if you&#39;re a bit squeamish about not making any cuts, $1$ can be made out of two halves: two copies of the building block that results when we take an apple and cut it into two equal pieces, taking just one of the pieces. (We write $\\frac{1}{2}$ for that half-sized building block.)\n- $2$ is a rational number: it can be made out of two lots of the $1$-building-block, or indeed out of four lots of the $\\frac{1}{2}$-building-block.\n- $\\frac{1}{2}$ is a rational number: it is just the half-sized building block itself.\n- If we took the apple and instead cut it into three pieces, we obtain a building block which we write as $\\frac{1}{3}$; so $\\frac{1}{3}$ is a rational number.\n- Two copies of the $\\frac{1}{3}$-building-block makes the rational number which we write $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n- Five copies of the $\\frac{1}{3}$-building-block makes somewhat more than one apple. Indeed, three of the building blocks can be put together to make one full apple, and then we&#39;ve got two building blocks left over. We write the rational number represented by five $\\frac{1}{3}$-building-blocks as $\\frac{5}{3}$.\n\n# Notation\n\nNow you&#39;ve seen the notation $\\frac{\\cdot}{\\cdot}$ used a few times, where there are numbers in the places of the dots.\nYou might be able to guess how this notation works in general now: if we take the blocks resulting when we divide an apple into &quot;dividey-number&quot;-many pieces, and then take &quot;lots&quot; of those pieces, then we obtain a rational number which we write as $\\frac{\\text{lots}}{\\text{dividey-number}}$.\nMathematicians use the words &quot;numerator&quot; and &quot;denominator&quot; for what I called &quot;lots&quot; and &quot;dividey-number&quot;; so it would be $\\frac{\\text{numerator}}{\\text{denominator}}$ to a mathematician.\n\n# Exercises\n\nCan you give some examples of how we can make the number $3$ from smaller building blocks? (There are lots and lots of ways you could correctly answer this question.)\n%%hidden(Show a possible solution):\nYou already know about one way from when we talked about the natural numbers: just take three copies of the $1$-block. (That is, three apples is three single apples put together.)\n\nAnother way would be to take six half-sized blocks: $\\frac{6}{2}$ is another way to write $3$.\n\nYet another way is to take fifteen fifth-sized blocks: $\\frac{15}{5}$ is another way to write $3$.\n\nIf you want to mix things up, you could take four half-sized blocks and three third-sized blocks: $\\frac{4}{2}$ and $\\frac{3}{3}$ together make $3$.\n![Three apples: four halves and three thirds](http://i.imgur.com/JBpqyko.png)\n%%\n\nIf you felt deeply uneasy about the last of my possible solutions above, there is a good and perfectly valid reason why you might have done; we will get to that eventually. If that was you, just forget I mentioned that last one for now.\nIf you were comfortable with it, that&#39;s also normal.\n\nHow about making the number $\\frac{1}{2}$ from smaller blocks?\n%%hidden(Show a possible solution):\nOf course, you could start by taking just one $\\frac{1}{2}$ block.\n\nFor a more interesting answer, you could take three copies of the sixth-sized block: $\\frac{3}{6}$ is the same as $\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\n![A half, expressed in sixths](http://i.imgur.com/5OBeBRE.png)\n\nAlternatively, five copies of the tenth-sized block: $\\frac{5}{10}$ is the same as $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n![A half, expressed in tenths](http://i.imgur.com/IfOm2xH.png)\n%%\n\nThe way I&#39;ve drawn the pictures might be suggestive: in some sense, when I&#39;ve given different answers just now, they all look like &quot;the same answer&quot; but with different lines drawn on.\nThat&#39;s because the rational numbers (&quot;fractions&quot;, remember) correspond to answers to the question &quot;how much?&quot;.\nWhile there is always more than one way to build a given rational number out of the building blocks, the way that we build the number doesn&#39;t affect the ultimate answer to the question &quot;how much?&quot;.\n$\\frac{5}{10}$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{3}{6}$ are all simply different ways of writing the same underlying quantity: the number which represents the fundamental concept of &quot;chop something into two equal pieces&quot;.\nThey each express different ways of making the same amount (for instance, out of five $\\frac{1}{10}$-blocks, or one $\\frac{1}{2}$-block), but the amount itself hasn&#39;t changed.\n\n# Going more general\n\nRemember, from when we treated the integers using cows, that I can give you a cow (even if I haven&#39;t got one) by creating a cow/anti-cow pair and then giving you the cow, leaving me with an anti-cow.\nWe count the number of anti-cows that I have by giving them a *negative* number.\n\nWe can do the same here with chunks of apple.\nIf I wanted to give you half an apple, but I didn&#39;t have any apples, I could create a half-apple/half-anti-apple pair, and then give you the half-apple; this would leave me with a half-anti-apple.\n\nWe count anti-apples in the same way as we count anti-cows: they are *negative*.\n\nSee the page on [56x subtraction] for a much more comprehensive explanation; this page is more of a whistle-stop tour.\n\n# Limitations\n\nWe&#39;ve had the idea of building-blocks: as $\\frac{1}{n}$, where $n$ was a natural number.\nWhy should $n$ be just a natural number, though?\nWe&#39;ve already seen the integers; why can&#39;t it be one of those? %%note:That is, why not let it be negative?%%\n\nAs it turns out, we *can* let $n$ be an integer, but we don&#39;t actually get anything new if we do.\nWe&#39;re going to pretend for the moment that $n$ has to be positive, because it gets a bit weird trying to divide things into three anti-chunks; this approach doesn&#39;t restrict us in any way, but if you are of a certain frame of mind, it might just look like a strange and artificial boundary to draw.\n\nHowever, you must note that $n$ cannot be $0$ (whatever your stance on dividing things into anti-chunks).\nWhile there is a way to finesse the idea of an anti-chunk %%note: And if you sit and think really hard for a long time, you might even come up with it yourself!%%, there is simply no way to make it possible to divide an apple into $0$ equal pieces.\nThat is, $\\frac{1}{0}$ is not a rational number (and you should be very wary of calling it anything that suggests it&#39;s like a number - like &quot;infinity&quot; - and under no account may you do arithmetic on it).\n\n# Summary\n\nSo far, you&#39;ve met what a rational number is! We haven&#39;t gone through how to do things with them yet, but hopefully you now understand vaguely what they&#39;re there for: they express the idea of &quot;dividing something up into parts&quot;, or &quot;sharing things out among people&quot; (if I have two apples to split fairly among three people, I can be fair by chopping each apple into three $\\frac{1}{3}$-sized building blocks, and then giving each person two of the blocks).\n\n[514 Next up], we will see how we can combine rational numbers together, eventually making a very convenient shorthand. %%note:The study of this shorthand is known as &quot;arithmetic&quot;.%%',
