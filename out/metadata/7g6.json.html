  text: 'Bollard&#39;s more conservative estimate is 38 hen-years per dollar, if you include other expenditures on farm animal welfare. I think we need to do include those because we didn&#39;t know in advance which efforts would be effective, and probably there will be some regression to the mean.\n\nIf you&#39;re thinking of this as an offset (instead of just directly comparing it to other charitable expenditures) then you need to credit other inputs - especially, the time of the people working at these places. Labor [captures](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LABSHPUSA156NRUG) about 60% of national income. People working at a charity are often taking a substantial pay cut relative to what they could get on the market, so let&#39;s say they capture 30% of the value. That means that for every \\$1 paid to employees of a leanly run nonprofit, the measured economic opportunity cost is a bit over \\$3 worth of GDP.\n\nThen there are the volunteers and people mobilized by CiWF. If we assume that each staff hour corresponds to about a similarly valuable commitment of volunteer hours (I genuinely have no idea if this is way too high or way too low) then each \\$1 spent on salary has an opportunity cost of about \\$6.\n\nAbout [half](http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/461/461822635/461822635_201412_990.pdf) of CIWF-US&#39;s expenses are salaries. Let&#39;s assume that this is true for their overall organization. Then for each dollar, \\$0.50 goes to salaries, with an economic opportunity cost of \\$3. The other \\$0.50 goes to other expenses, which we&#39;ll assume are rents, supplies, etc., all purchased at market rate from for-profit businesses capturing a normal return on capital and labor, so let&#39;s say the true opportunity cost is \\$0.50. Thus, donating \\$1 to CiWF actually costs \\$3.50 in economic value, so you should only get credited for about 38 / 3.5 = 11 hen-years per dollar.\n\nThat&#39;s still a pretty high number. But how does the suffering alleviated here compare with the suffering inflicted by a year of eating factory farmed animal products? Let&#39;s say that about a third of the net suffering laying hens do comes from the cages themselves.\n\nIt seems like the [vast majority](http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/) of farmed animal suffering measured in animal-days (not adjusting for brain size) comes from poultry and eggs, since chickens are so small - and most slaughters will be attributable to such animals too, for similar reasons. But maybe broiler chickens suffer more than ordinary chickens. I can imagine being indifferent to spending ten days as a caged laying hen and a day as a broiler chicken (though I suspect the true ratio is smaller). So, on that model, a dollar alleviates suffering equivalent to about a third of a year of a broiler chicken&#39;s life.\n\nIf you&#39;re eating about a kg per day of meat, and about half of it is chicken, you&#39;re responsible for about 13 days&#39; worth of broiler chicken suffering per day (assuming away elasticity considerations in the long run), i.e. 13 years&#39; worth of broiler chicken suffering per year, so you&#39;d need to give 13 * \\$3 = \\$39 per year to offset that diet. If you&#39;re not eating much chicken, it would take much less.',
