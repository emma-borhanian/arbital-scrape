This policy will, given a stable maze, have the same consequence next time\\.\nFaced with a superior chessplayer, we enter a state of Vingean uncertainty in which we are more sure about the final consequence of the chessplayer&#39;s moves \\- that it wins the game \\- than we have any surety about the particular moves made\\.  To put it another way, the main abstract fact we know about the chessplayer&#39;s next move is that the consequence of the move will be winning\\.\nAs a chessplayer becomes strongly superhuman, its play becomes instrumentally efficient in the sense that no abstract description of the moves takes precedence over the consequence of the move\\.  A weak computer chessplayer might be described in terms like &quot;It likes to move its pawn&quot; or &quot;it tries to grab control of the center&quot;, but as the chess play improves past the human level, we can no longer detect any divergence from &quot;it makes the moves that will win the game later&quot; that we can describe in terms like &quot;it tries to control the center \\(whether or not that&#39;s really the winning move\\)&quot;\\.  In other words, as a chessplayer becomes more powerful, we stop being able to describe its moves that will ever take priority over our beliefs that the moves have a certain consequence\\.\n',
