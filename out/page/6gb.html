For every object $~$x$~$, $~$x$~$ is not in $~$\emptyset$~$.]</p>
<p>The empty set, $~$\emptyset$~$, is the set with no elements.
Why, <em>a priori</em>, should this set exist at all?
Well, if we think of sets as "containers of elements", the idea of an empty container is intuitive: just imagine a box with nothing in it.</p>
<h1 id="definitions">Definitions</h1>
<h2 id="definitioninzf">Definition in [ZF]</h2>
<p>In the set theory [ZF], there are exactly two axioms which assert the existence of a set <em>ex nihilo</em>; all of the rest of set theory builds sets from those given sets, or else postulates the existence of more sets.</p>
<p>There is the [-axiom_of_infinity], which asserts the existence of an infinite set, and there is the [-empty_set_axiom], which asserts that an empty set exists.</p>
<p>In fact, we can deduce the existence of an empty set even without using the empty set axiom, as long as we are allowed to use the [-axiom_of_comprehension] to select a certain specially-chosen subset of an infinite set.
More formally: let $~$X$~$ be an infinite set (as guaranteed by the axiom of infinity).
Then select the subset of $~$X$~$ consisting of all those members $~$x$~$ of $~$X$~$ which have the property that $~$x$~$ contains $~$X$~$ and also does not contain $~$X$~$.</p>
<p>There are no such members, so we must have just constructed an empty set.</p>
<h2 id="definitionbyauniversalproperty">Definition by a universal property</h2>
<p>The empty set <a href="empty_set_universal_property.html">has a definition</a> in terms of a <a href="universal_property.html">Universal property</a>: the empty set is the unique set $~$X$~$ such that for every set $~$A$~$, there is exactly one map from $~$X$~$ to $~$A$~$.
More succinctly, it is the [-initial_object] in the [-category_of_sets] (or in the <a href="category_of_finite_sets.html">Category of finite sets</a>).</p>
<h1 id="uniquenessoftheemptyset">Uniqueness of the empty set</h1>
<p>The [-axiom_of_extensionality] states that two sets are the same if and only if they have exactly the same elements.
If we had two empty sets $~$A$~$ and $~$B$~$, then certainly anything in $~$A$~$ is also in $~$B$~$ ([vacuous_truth vacuously]), and anything in $~$B$~$ is also in $~$A$~$, so they have the same elements.
Therefore $~$A = B$~$, and we have shown the uniqueness of the empty set.</p>
<h1 id="acommonmisconceptionddemptysetddvsddemptysetdd">A common misconception: $~$\emptyset$~$ vs $~$\{ \emptyset \}$~$</h1>
<p>It is very common for people to start out by getting confused between $~$\emptyset$~$ and $~$\{\emptyset\}$~$.
The first contains no elements; the second is a set containing exactly one element (namely $~$\emptyset$~$).
The sets don't <a href="bijective_function.html">biject</a>, because they are finite and have different numbers of elements.</p>
<h1 id="vacuous_truthvacuoustruthawhistlestoptour">[vacuous_truth Vacuous truth]: a whistlestop tour</h1>
<p>The idea of vacuous truth can be stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For <em>any</em> property $~$P$~$, everything in $~$\emptyset$~$ has the property $~$P$~$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a bit unintuitive at first sight: it's true that everything in $~$\emptyset$~$ is the Pope, for instance.
Why should this be the case?</p>
<p>In order for there to be a counterexample to the statement that "everything in $~$\emptyset$~$ is the Pope", we would need to find an element of $~$\emptyset$~$ which was not the Pope. %%note: Strictly, we'd only need to show that such an element must exist, without necessarily finding it.%%
But there aren't <em>any</em> elements of $~$\emptyset$~$, let alone elements which fail to be the Pope.
So there can't be any counterexample to the statement that "everything in $~$\emptyset$~$ is the Pope", so the statement is true.</p></main><hr><footer><p class="likes"><h2>Likes</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/EricBruylant.html">Eric Bruylant</a></span></p></footer></body></html>
