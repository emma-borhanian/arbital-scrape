If the payoff matrix is CC:2/2, CD:0/3, DD: 1/1, then if LDT cooperates in every round it will get $~$99\cdot 2=198$~$ utilons, while if it defected then it gets $~$100$~$ utilons.</p>
<p>Thus $~$LDT$~$ wins $~$198$~$ utilons in this situation, while a CDT agent in his shoes would win $~$100$~$ utilons by defecting each round.</p>
<p>The situation changes if the payoff becomes <em>Having a higher score that CDT</em>: $~$1$~$,  while <em>Having an equal or lower score than CDT</em>: $~$0$~$.</p>
<p>Then the game is clearly rigged, as there is no deterministic strategy that LDT could follow that would lead to a win. But neither could CDT win if it was pitted in the same situation.</p></main><hr><section class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/EliezerYudkowsky.html">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a></p><p><p>I'll edit to be more precise: A CDT agent thinks "me and an LDT agent facing off against 99 other LDT agents in a oneshot PD tournament" is a fair test of it versus the LDT agent.  A CDT agent does <em>not</em> think that "Me facing off against 99 CDT agents and 1 LDT agent, versus an LDT agent facing 99 LDT agents and 1 CDT agent" is a fair and symmetrical test.  On the CDT view, the LDT agent is being presented with an entirely different payoff matrix for its options in the second test.</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/JaimeSevillaMolina.html">Jaime Sevilla Molina</a></p><p><p>I do not think that the "Me facing off against 99 CDT agents and 1 LDT agent, versus an LDT agent facing 99 LDT agents and 1 CDT agent" is fair either.</p>
<p>The thing that confuses me is that you are changing the universe in which you put the agents to compete. </p>
<p>To my understanding, the universe should be something of the form "{blank} against a CDT agent and 100 LDT agents in a one-shot prisoners dilemma tournament", and then you fill the "blank" with agents and compare their scores.</p>
<p>If you are using different universe templates for different agents then you are violating extensionality, and I hardly can consider that a fair test.</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/EliezerYudkowsky.html">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a></p><p><p>Makes sense (though the versus you quote wasn't being advocated as a fair example by either agent).
