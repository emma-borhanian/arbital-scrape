My plan is to gradually develop it into a full fledged tutorial on order theory (which might take awhile). I see that you have invited me to the mathematics domain. Do I need to <em>join</em> this domain somehow?</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/AlexeiAndreev.html">Alexei Andreev</a></p><p><p>Sounds good!</p>
<p>The invite text is a bit unclear. You don't need to do anything; you already have the permissions to create/edit pages in math domain.</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/KevinClancy.html">Kevin Clancy</a></p><p><p>After another session of using Arbital, I have a few questions and comments.</p>
<p>1.) Is there any mechanism for citations? There probably should be. A lot of what I have written about order theory so far is inspired by Davey and Priestly's Introduction to Lattices and Order. I don't think it's realistic for someone to pull an entire tutorial on a mathematical topic directly out of their brain.</p>
<p>2.) I love the hover-over definition display. It's very convenient for looking up definitions without having to transition to other pages.</p>
<p>3.) It seems that it would be useful to be able embed arbital pages inside of other arbital pages. Here's the motivation. Let's say that I have a definition of poset, much like the one in this order theory tutorial, but in its own page. It's convenient to have short definition pages (<a href="set_mathematics.html">like this one</a>) for use with hover-over. However, in this order theory tutorial I don't want to replace the definition of poset with a link, because it's an important part of order theory and there may be other text on this page that refers to it. Yet we still want to give the definition of poset its own page. Right now, it seems that the best way to do this involves redundancy: have two poset definitions, one embedded in the tutorial, and the other on its own page, including essentially the same content. This redundancy does not seem ideal. This feature sounds like it would be a nightmare to implement, but it would be really useful.</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/AlexeiAndreev.html">Alexei Andreev</a></p><p><ol>
<li><p>Not yet. You can just do footnotes like "[1]" or make them links, like <a href="https://arbital.com">[1]</a></p></li>
<li><p>Great!</p></li>
<li><p>Noted! We actually had a feature like it some time ago and are planning to bring it back before long. It's not clear what shape it'll take, but something like it is definitely necessary.</p></li>
