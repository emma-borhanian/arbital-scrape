Arbital discussion norms say to explicitly note this as &quot;psychologizing&quot;.</p><nav class="breadcrumbs"><nav class="breadcrumb" aria-label="Breadcrumb"><ul><li><a href="../index.html">Index</a></li><li>Psychologizing</li></ul></nav><nav class="breadcrumb" aria-label="Breadcrumb"><ul><li><a href="rationality.html">Rationality</a></li><li><a href="epistemology.html">Epistemology</a></li><li>…</li></ul></nav></nav></header><hr><main><p>"Psychologizing" is when we go past arguing that a position <em>is in fact</em> wrong, and start considering <em>what could have gone wrong in people's minds</em> to make them believe something so wrong.  Realistically, we can't entirely avoid psychologizing - sometimes cognitive biases are real and understanding how they potentially apply is important.  Nonetheless, since psychologizing is potentially a pernicious and poisonous activity, Arbital's discussion norms say to explicitly tag or greenlink with "<a href="psychologizing.html">Psychologizing</a>" each place where you speculate about the psychology of how people could possibly be so wrong.  Again, psychologizing isn't necessarily wrong - sometimes people do make mistakes for systematic psychological reasons that are understandable - but it's dangerous, potentially degenerates extremely quickly, and deserves to be highlighted each and every time.</p>
<p>If you go off on an extended discourse about why somebody is mentally biased or thinking poorly, <em>before</em> you've argued on the object level that they are in fact mistaken about the subject matter, this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulverism">Bulverism</a>.  Bulverism is flatly not okay on Arbital.  If you want to speculate about what goes wrong in the minds of people who believe in UFOs, then a good way of doing this on Arbital would be to <em>first</em> link a page arguing that there are in fact no UFOs, and say "I think this page establishes there are no UFOs; if you're not familiar with the arguments, read that first.  Given that I think there are in fact no UFOs, I will now <a href="psychologizing.html">psychologize</a> about why people would mistakenly believe in UFOs…"</p>
<p>If that clear label makes your page less snappy, persuasive, and fun to read, please consider that to be an <em>intended effect</em> of this rule.  Psychologizing <em>is</em> fun and that's why we want to take steps against it coming to dominate discussions here.</p></main><hr><footer><p class="likes"><h2>Likes</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/EliTyre.html">Eli Tyre</a>,
