Face recognition is a 'domain', as is playing chess, or driving a car.  Each of these domains presents characteristic options and modes of action for accomplishing the task: a Go game can be won by outputting good Go moves, a car can be moved safely to its definition by turning, accelerating, and braking.  The <em>real-world domain</em> is the superdomain that contains all of reality.  In reality, you could try to win a chess game by making funny faces to distract the opponent, and a driving problem has solutions like 'work for a salary and use the money to pay for an Uber'.  If you can reason like this then you are acting in the 'real-world domain'.</p>
<p>Being able to act in the real-world domain is distinct from <em>realistic</em> domains.  Driving a robotic car is a <em>realistic</em> domain: solutions must be computed in real-time, everything is continuous rather than turn-based, a deer could wander across the road at any time, sensors and knowledge are imperfect, and sometimes a tire blows out.  Even so, a standard robotic driver that faces this class of events will act through the medium of steering and acceleration.  If instead the robotic driver switched to running a hedge fund and hired a human to drive the car using the money it earned, it would have taken advantage of such a breadth of options that the only domain wide enough to contain those options is 'the real world', reality itself where anything goes so long as it works.</p>
<p>Acting in the real world is an <a href="advanced_agent.html">advanced agent property</a> and would likely follow from the advanced agent property of <a href="agi.html">Artificial General Intelligence</a>: the ability to learn new domains would lead to the ability to act through modalities covering many different kinds of real-world options.</p></main><hr><footer></footer></body></html>
