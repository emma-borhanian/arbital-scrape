What would you say is your general math level?


<mark>I'm bad at math\.

I'm not bad at math, but I'm not especially good at it either\.</mark>

I can have fun with math, and I won't be anxious if I see a word problem I don't already know how to solve\.

I am a programmer, physical engineer, or some other profession that calls on me to sometimes think in algebra\.

I do research\-level math\.  Hit me with the LaTeX formulas\.

<p>Joe made a good point about the way this is phrased not sorting people quite right:</p>
<p>joe [11:50 AM]<br />
“bad at math” = out of Arbital’s range</p>
<p>eric_bruylant [11:50 AM]<br />
currently, yes
the bad at math we're talking about is significantly a psychological aversion, not lack of background</p>
<p>joe [11:51 AM]<br />
I’d say one of the things you might want to do</p>
<p>is to … oh</p>
<p>eric_bruylant [11:51 AM]<br />
and we can't do therapy yet</p>
<p>joe [11:51 AM]<br />
in that case, I think it’s somewhat poorly worded</p>
<p>because some people who are not psychologically averse might still consider themselves “bad at math”</p>
<p>just because they never really put any effort into it</p>
<p>like, they can’t multiply two-digit numbers, but they’d whip out a calculator if they had to</p>
<p>anyway: I’d say one of the things you might want to do is to have a list of problems that those people should be able to understand the full meaning of, although not necessarily solve</p>
<p>eric_bruylant [11:52 AM]<br />
hm, yea. I kinda agree, though I'm not sure how to get all the people with an aversion</p>
<p>joe [11:53 AM]<br />
I’d say more, “I don’t like math.”</p>
<p>eric_bruylant [11:53 AM]<br />
since many of them won't realize the issue is an aversion rather than them being bad at math</p>
<p>that seems like an improvement to me</p>
<p>I'll put a mark on the page about it</p>
<p>joe [11:54 AM]<br />
and I’d reword math 0 to “I don’t ​<em>hate</em>​ math, but I’m not particularly good at it.” (edited)</p>
<p>since Math 0 is supposed to represent “not very skilled”</p>
<p>eric_bruylant [11:54 AM]<br />
seems good</p>
<p>joe [11:54 AM]<br />
so they ​<em>are</em>​ “bad at math”, just not bad enough to have a phobia around it</p></main><hr><section class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/EricBruylant.html">Eric Bruylant</a></p><p><p>Note: I'm not certain about the alternate wording, and meant to suggest changes to the math 0 or math 1 pages rather than directly here.
