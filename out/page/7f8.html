I assume it's the base structure of the math explanation incarnation of Arbital, and could be brought back to the surface to make it more discoverable.  I see value in having a feed/domain/repository just of terms, so they can be explored differently than you would a claim or a post.</p>
<p>Also, what are splits?</p>
<p>Did you know that XX% of user requests are for features that already exist that users can't find? :-)</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/EricBruylant.html">Eric Bruylant</a></p><p><p>Yep, that is what I meant. Create new page is less exposed now we've moved the <a href="https://arbital.com/math/">Arbital math home</a>. It's accessible via the hamburger menu in the top right still, and you can link to it like <a href="https://arbital.com/edit/">this</a>, but that's not particularly easy to find. I'm pretty sure we'll want to improve that, and generally make it easier to navigate between the wiki and discussion areas of Arbital.</p>
<p>Yep, I think when we've got good support for browsing by tag we'll be able to tag things with #term or #definition, and it'll work?</p>
<p>By splits I just meant if people disagree they could make alternate terms, maybe crosslinking with "maybe you want this term"? No special features.</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/AndreaGallagher.html">Andrea Gallagher</a></p><p><p>Let me experiment with using a Page for this purpose, and see what seems like it's missing.</p>
<p>I think Jim's suggestions below are good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terms should have summaries</li>
<li>Let the summary show as a tool tip or roll-over, so the reader doesn't have to leave the flow of the article</li>
<li>make it really easy to mark a word as a term (and perhaps even auto suggest if a term page is available for a string of a given length).</li>
