<h2 id="acunningplan">A cunning plan</h2>
<p>There's a two-player game called 10 questions, in which player A begins the game by stating "I'm thinking of an X", where X can be replaced with any noun of player A's choosing.</p>
<p>Then player B asks player A a series of questions, which player A must answer with either truthfully with "yes" or "no". After asking 10 questions, player B is forced to guess what the object player A was thinking of. Player B wins if the guess is correct, and loses otherwise. Player B may guess before 10 turns have expired, in which case the guess counts as one of
their questions.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a game of 10 questions:</p>
<p>A: I'm thinking of a food.</p>
<p>Question 1. 
B: Is it healthy? 
A: Yes.</p>
<p>Question 2.
B: Is it crunchy? 
A: No.</p>
<p>Question 3.
B: Must it be prepared before it is eaten?
A: No.</p>
<p>Question 4.
B: Is yellow? 
A: Yes.</p>
<p>Question 5.
B: Is it a banana? 
A: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Player B wins</strong></p>
<p>Now suppose that you are playing 10 questions as player B. Player A begins by stating
"I'm thinking of a letter of the alphabet." You immediately think of a strategy
that requires no more than 5 guesses: repeatedly ask "does it come after $~$\star$~$?"
where $~$\star$~$ is near the middle of the contiguous sequence of letters that you have
not yet eliminated. Initially the contiguous sequence of letters between A and Z
have not been eliminated.</p>
<p>Question 1.
<em>You:</em> Does it come after M?
<em>Player A:</em> Yes.</p>
<p>At this point, the contiguous sequence of 13 letters that have not been eliminated is N-Z,
inclusive.</p>
<p>Question 2.
<em>You:</em> Does it come after S? <em>Player A:</em> No.</p>
<p>At this point, the contiguous sequence of 6 letters that have not been eliminated is N-S,
inclusive.</p>
<p>Question 3. <em>You:</em> Does it come after P?  <em>Player A:</em> Yes.</p>
<p>We've now narrowed it down to Q,R,and S.</p>
<p>Question 4. <em>You:</em> Does it come after R? <em>Player A:</em> No.</p>
<p>Question 5. <em>You:</em> Does it come after Q? <em>Player A:</em> No.</p>
<p><em>You:</em> Is it Q? <em>Player A:</em> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>You win</strong></p>
<p>But what does this have to do with monotone functions? The letters of the alphabet form a poset $~$Alph = \langle \{A,…,Z\}, \leq_{Alph} \rangle$~$ (in fact, a <a href="totally_ordered_set.html">totally ordered set</a>) under the standard alphabetic order. Your strategy for playing 10 questions can be viewed as probing a monotone function from $~$Alph$~$ to the 2-element poset <strong>2</strong> of a <a href="boolean.html">boolean values</a>, where $~$false <_{\textbf{2}} true$~$. Specifically, the probed function $~$f : Alph \to \textbf{2}$~$ is defined such that $~$f(\star) \doteq Q >_{Alph} \star$~$ </p>
<p>The monotonicity of $~$f$~$ is crucial to being able to eliminate possibilities at each step. If we probe $~$f$~$ at a letter $~$\star_1$~$ and observe a false result, then any letter $~$\star_2$~$ less than $~$\star_1$~$ must map to false as well: $~$\star_2 \leq_{Alph} \star_1$~$ implies $~$f(\star_2) \leq_{\textbf{2}} f(\star_1)$~$. Yes, we can demonstrate the aformentioned monotone function with a diagram, but since its size is unwieldy, it has been placed in the following hidden text block.</p>

<h2 id="deductionsystems">Deduction systems</h2>
<p>[deduction_systems] allow one to infer new judgments from a set of known judgments. They are often specified as a set of rules, in which each rule is represented as a horizontal bar with one or more premises appearing above the bar and a conclusion that can be deduced from those premises appearing below the bar. </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OFx6REF.png" alt="A deduction system" /></p>
<p>The above rules form a fragment of <a href="boolean.html">propositional logic</a>. $~$\phi$~$ and $~$\psi$~$ are used to denote logical statements, called <em>propositions</em>. $~$\wedge$~$ and $~$\to$~$ are binary logical operators, each of which maps a pair of propositions to a single proposition. $~$\wedge$~$ is the <em>and</em> operator: if $~$\phi$~$ and $~$\psi$~$ are logical statements, then $~$\phi \wedge \psi$~$ is the simultaneous assertion of both $~$\phi$~$ and $~$\psi$~$. $~$\to$~$ is the <em>implication</em> operator: $~$\phi \to \psi$~$ asserts that if we know $~$\phi$~$ to be true, then we can conclude $~$\psi$~$ is true as well.</p>
<p>The leftmost rule has two premises $~$\phi$~$ and $~$\psi$~$, and concludes from these premises the proposition $~$\phi \wedge \psi$~$. Invoking a rule to deduce its conclusion from its premises is called <em>applying</em> the rule. A tree of rule applications is called a [proof proof].</p>
<p>Deduction systems are often viewed as proof languages. However, it can also be fruitful to view a deduction system as a function which, given a set of input propositions, produces the set of all propositions that can be concluded from exactly one rule application, using the input propositions as premises. More concretely, letting $~$X$~$ be the set of propositions, the above set of deduction rules corresponds to the following function $~$F : \mathcal P(X) \to \mathcal P(X)$~$.</p>
<p>$~$F(A) = \\ ~~ \{ \phi \wedge \psi\mid\phi \in A, \psi \in A \} \cup \\ ~~ \{ \phi \mid \phi \wedge \psi \in A \} \cup \\ ~~ \{ \psi \mid \phi \wedge \psi \in A \} \cup \\ ~~ \{ \phi \mid \psi \in A, \psi \to \phi \in A \}$~$</p>
<p>$~$F$~$ is a montone function from the poset $~$\langle \mathcal P(X), \subseteq \rangle$~$ to itself. The reason that $~$F$~$ is monotone is that larger input sets give us more ways to apply the rules of our system, yielding larger outputs.</p>
<p>In addition to standard logical notions, deduction systems can be used to describe [type_system type systems], [program_logic program logics], and [operational_semantics operational semantics].</p>

<p>If you still haven't had enough monotonicity, might I recommend trying some of the <a href="order_monotone_exercises.html">exercises</a>?</p>
<p>%comment:</p>
<h2 id="increasingfunctions">Increasing functions</h2>
<p>A monotone function between two <a href="totally_ordered_set.html">totally ordered sets</a> is called increasing. For example, the graph of a monotone function from the poset $~$\langle \mathbb R, \le \rangle$~$ to itself has an upward slope. Such functions can be searched efficiently using the [binary_search binary search algorithm].<br />
