<p>Doesn't make sense? Let's backtrack a little.</p>
<h2 id="motivationexpandingthedefinitionofnumbers">Motivation - expanding the definition of numbers</h2>
<p>Say we start with a child's understanding of numbers as counting numbers, or <a href="natural_number.html">natural numbers</a>. Using only natural numbers we can add and multiply whichever numbers we want, but there are some restrictions on subtraction: ask a child to subtract 5 from 3 and they'll say "you can't do that!".</p>
<p>In order to allow the computation of numbers like $~$5-3$~$, we need to define a new kind of number: negative numbers. The set of natural numbers, negative numbers and $~$0$~$ is called whole numbers, or <a href="integer.html">integers</a>. Unlike natural numbers, with integers we can add and subtract whatever we want. (In math terms, we say the set of integers is <a href="closure_mathematics.html">closed</a> to addition.)</p>
<p>We still have a problem, though: what about division? Going back to our child analogy, say we're talking to a third grader. If you ask them to divide 8 by 2, no problem. But what if you as them to divide 2 by 8? "You can't do that!"</p>
<p>Just like with negative numbers, we need to define a new kind of number: fractions, like $~$\frac{1}{2}, \frac{5}{3}$~$ or $~$-\frac{6}{7}$~$. By adding fractions to the integers, we get a more general set of numbers - <a href="rational_number.html">rational numbers</a>. With rational numbers we can multiply and divide however we want - the set of rational numbers is closed to multiplication. Well, except dividing by zero. No one has figured out how to do that without breaking mathematics, so that's awkward.</p>
<p>Now say our child is a seventh grader, so they know about square roots. They can apply the square root operation to any perfect square, no problem - $~$\sqrt{9}=3$~$. But what if you ask them to find the square root of a non-perfect square, like $~$\sqrt{2}$~$? "You can't do that!"</p>
<p>Once again, we need to expand our set of numbers to include a new kind of number: irrational numbers. Unlike we discussed with negative numbers or fractions, irrationals can do a whole lot more that just define square roots. In fact, irrationals are so cool that according to some sources the Pythagoreans couldn't deal with their existence and ended up killing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippasus">the guy who invented them</a>.</p>
<p>Adding irrational numbers to our set of rational numbers, we get the <a href="real_number.html">real numbers</a>. Mathematically, we say that the reals are a [real_number_completeness complete] <a href="totally_ordered_set.html">ordered</a> <a href="algebraic_field.html">field</a>, which is actually one of the ways of defining them. </p>
<p>However, there's still one problem: the real numbers are not an [-algebraically_closed_field]. In a practical sense, this means we still don't have closure under the square root operation $~$\sqrt{}$~$, because we can't define the square roots of negative numbers.</p>
<p>By now you've probably noticed the pattern, though: any time someone says "you can't do that!", mathematicians invent a new kind of number to prove them wrong.</p>
<h2 id="introducingimaginarynumbers">Introducing: imaginary numbers</h2>
<p>In order to allow using the square root operation on negative numbers, we once again have to define a new kind of number: imaginary numbers. </p>
<p>Actually, we have to define just one number - the imaginary unit, $~$\textrm{i}$~$. $~$\textrm{i}$~$ is defined as a solution to the quadratic equation $~$x^2+1=0$~$. In other words, we can define $~$\textrm{i}$~$ as equaling $~$\sqrt{-1}$~$.</p>
<p>All the other imaginary numbers (square roots of negatives) follow directly from this definition of $~$\textrm{i}$~$: for any negative number $~$-a$~$, we can define $~$\sqrt{-a}=\textrm{i}\sqrt{a}$~$.</p>

<p>This article is unfinished, and will later include an explanation of the complex plane as well as the algebraic properties of complex numbers.</p>
