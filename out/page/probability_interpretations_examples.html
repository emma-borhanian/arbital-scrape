<p>Consider evaluating, in June of 2016, the question:  "What is the probability of Hillary Clinton winning the 2016 US presidential election?"</p>
<p>On the <strong>propensity</strong> view, Hillary has some fundamental chance of winning the election.  To ask about the probability is to ask about this objective chance.  If we see a prediction market in which prices move after each new poll &mdash; so that it says 60% one day, and 80% a week later &mdash; then clearly the prediction market isn't giving us very strong information about this objective chance, since it doesn't seem very likely that Clinton's <em>real</em> chance of winning is swinging so rapidly.</p>
<p>On the <strong>frequentist</strong> view, we cannot formally or rigorously say anything about the 2016 presidential election, because it only happens once.  We can't <em>observe</em> a frequency with which Clinton wins presidential elections.  A frequentist might concede that they would cheerfully buy for \$1 a ticket that pays \$20 if Clinton wins, considering this a favorable bet in an <em>informal</em> sense, while insisting that this sort of reasoning isn't sufficiently rigorous, and therefore isn't suitable for being included in science journals.</p>
<p>On the <strong>subjective</strong> view, saying that Hillary has an 80% chance of winning the election summarizes our <em>knowledge about</em> the election or our <em>state of uncertainty</em> given what we currently know.  It makes sense for the prediction market prices to change in response to new polls, because our current state of knowledge is changing.</p>
<h2 id="acoinwithanunknownbias">A coin with an unknown bias</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a coin, weighted so that it lands heads somewhere between 0% and 100% of the time, but we don't know the coin's actual bias.</p>
<p>The coin is then flipped three times where we can see it.  It comes up heads twice, and tails once:  HHT.</p>
<p>The coin is then flipped again, where nobody can see it yet.  An honest and trustworthy experimenter lets you spin a wheel-of-gambling-odds,%note:The reason for spinning the wheel-of-gambling-odds is to reduce the worry that the experimenter might know more about the coin than you, and be offering you a deliberately rigged bet.% and the wheel lands on (2 : 1).  The experimenter asks if you'd enter into a gamble where you win \$2 if the unseen coin flip is tails, and pay \$1 if the unseen coin flip is heads.</p>
<p>On a <strong>propensity</strong> view, the coin has some objective probability between 0 and 1 of being heads, but we just don't know what this probability is.  Seeing HHT tells us that the coin isn't all-heads or all-tails, but we're still just guessing &mdash; we don't really know the answer, and can't say whether the bet is a fair bet.</p>
<p>On a <strong>frequentist</strong> view, the coin would (if flipped repeatedly) produce some long-run frequency $~$f$~$ of heads that is between 0 and 1.  If we kept flipping the coin long enough, the actual proportion $~$p$~$ of observed heads is guaranteed to approach $~$f$~$ arbitrarily closely, eventually.  We can't say that the <em>next</em> coin flip is guaranteed to be H or T, but we can make an objectively true statement that $~$p$~$ will approach $~$f$~$ to within epsilon if we continue to flip the coin long enough.</p>
<p>To decide whether or not to take the bet, a frequentist might try to apply an [unbiased_estimator unbiased estimator] to the data we have so far.  An "unbiased estimator" is a rule for taking an observation and producing an estimate $~$e$~$ of $~$f$~$, such that the <a href="expected_value.html">expected value</a> of $~$e$~$ is $~$f$~$.  In other words, a frequentist wants a rule such that, if the hidden bias of the coin was in fact to yield 75% heads, and we repeat many times the operation of flipping the coin a few times and then asking a new frequentist to estimate the coin's bias using this rule, the <em>average</em> value of the estimated bias will be 0.75.  This is a property of the <em>estimation rule</em> which is objective.  We can't hope for a rule that will always, in any particular case, yield the true $~$f$~$ from just a few coin flips; but we can have a rule which will provably have an <em>average</em> estimate of $~$f$~$, if the experiment is repeated many times.</p>
<p>In this case, a simple unbiased estimator is to guess that the coin's bias $~$f$~$ is equal to the observed proportion of heads, or 2/3. In other words, if we repeat this experiment many many times, and whenever we see $~$p$~$ heads in 3 tosses we guess that the coin's bias is $~$\frac{p}{3}$~$, then this rule definitely is an unbiased estimator. This estimator says that a bet of \$2 vs. $\1 is fair, meaning that it doesn't yield an expected profit, so we have no reason to take the bet.</p>
<p>On a <strong>subjectivist</strong> view, we start out personally unsure of where the bias $~$f$~$ lies within the interval [0, 1].  Unless we have any knowledge or suspicion leading us to think otherwise, the coin is just as likely to have a bias between 33% and 34%, as to have a bias between 66% and 67%; there's no reason to think it's more likely to be in one range or the other.</p>
<p>Each coin flip we see is then <a href="bayes_strength_of_evidence.html">evidence</a> about the value of $~$f,$~$ since a flip H happens with different probabilities depending on the different values of $~$f,$~$ and we update our beliefs about $~$f$~$ using <a href="bayes_rule_functional.html">Bayes&#39; rule</a>. For example, H is twice as likely if $~$f=\frac{2}{3}$~$ than if $~$f=\frac{1}{3}$~$ so by <a href="bayes_rule_proportional.html">Bayes&#39;s Rule</a> we should now think $~$f$~$ is twice as likely to lie near $~$\frac{2}{3}$~$ as it is to lie near $~$\frac{1}{3}$~$.</p>
<p>When we start with a uniform <a href="ignorance_prior.html">prior</a>, observe multiple flips of a coin with an unknown bias, see M heads and N tails, and then try to estimate the odds of the next flip coming up heads, the result is <a href="laplace_rule_of_succession.html">Laplace&#39;s Rule of Succession</a> which estimates (M + 1) : (N + 1) for a probability of $~$\frac{M + 1}{M + N + 2}.$~$</p>
<p>In this case, after observing HHT, we estimate odds of 2 : 3 for tails vs. heads on the next flip.  This makes a gamble that wins \$2 on tails and loses \$1 on heads a profitable gamble in expectation, so we take the bet.</p>
<p>Our choice of a <a href="ignorance_prior.html">uniform prior</a> over $~$f$~$ was a little dubious &mdash; it's the obvious way to express total ignorance about the bias of the coin, but obviousness isn't everything. (For example, maybe we actually believe that a fair coin is more likely than a coin biased 50.0000023% towards heads.) However, all the reasoning after the choice of prior was rigorous according to the laws of <a href="probability_theory.html">probability theory</a>, which is the [probability_coherence_theorems only method of manipulating quantified uncertainty] that obeys obvious-seeming rules about how subjective uncertainty should behave.</p>
<h2 id="probabilitythatthe98765thdecimaldigitofddpiddisdd0dd">Probability that the 98,765th decimal digit of $~$\pi$~$ is $~$0$~$.</h2>
<p>What is the probability that the 98,765th digit in the decimal expansion of $~$\pi$~$ is $~$0$~$?</p>
<p>The <strong>propensity</strong> and <strong>frequentist</strong> views regard as nonsense the notion that we could talk about the <em>probability</em> of a mathematical fact.  Either the 98,765th decimal digit of $~$\pi$~$ is $~$0$~$ or it's not.  If we're running <em>repeated</em> experiments with a random number generator, and looking at different digits of $~$\pi,$~$ then it might make sense to say that the random number generator has a 10% probability of picking numbers whose corresponding decimal digit of $~$\pi$~$ is $~$0$~$.  But if we're just picking a non-random number like 98,765, there's no sense in which we could say that the 98,765th digit of $~$\pi$~$ has a 10% propensity to be $~$0$~$, or that this digit is $~$0$~$ with 10% frequency in the long run.</p>
<p>The <strong>subjectivist</strong> considers probabilities to just refer to their own uncertainty.  So if a subjectivist has picked the number 98,765 without yet knowing the corresponding digit of $~$\pi,$~$ and hasn't made any observation that is known to them to be entangled with the 98,765th digit of $~$\pi,$~$ and they're pretty sure their friend hasn't yet looked up the 98,765th digit of $~$\pi$~$ either, and their friend offers a whimsical gamble that costs \$1 if the digit is non-zero and pays \$20 if the digit is zero, the Bayesian takes the bet.</p>
<p>Note that this demonstrates a difference between the subjectivist interpretation of "probability" and Bayesian probability theory. A perfect Bayesian reasoner that knows the rules of logic and the definition of $~$\pi$~$ must, by the axioms of probability theory, assign probability either 0 or 1 to the claim "the 98,765th digit of $~$\pi$~$ is a $~$0$~$" (depending on whether or not it is). This is one of the reasons why [bayes_intractable perfect Bayesian reasoning is intractable]. A subjectivist that is not a perfect Bayesian nevertheless claims that they are personally uncertain about the value of the 98,765th digit of $~$\pi.$~$ Formalizing the rules of subjective probabilities about mathematical facts (in the way that <a href="probability_theory.html">Probability theory</a> formalized the rules for manipulating subjective probabilities about empirical facts, such as which way a coin came up) is an open problem; this in known as the problem of <a href="logical_uncertainty.html">Logical Uncertainty</a>.</p></main><hr><footer><p class="all-creators"><h2>All Creators</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/AlexeiAndreev.html">Alexei Andreev</a>,
