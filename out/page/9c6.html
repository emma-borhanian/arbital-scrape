<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>The coliteracy of two parties is, loosely, the degree to which they have a shared language with stable meanings, subject to a domain of discussion. Here, the "meaning" of a word or contextual utterance is unspecified, but intuitively refers to a probability space of other utterances and inarticulated experiences that the subject would rate as synonymous. The coliteracy of two parties against a single contextual utterance, then, can be imagined as the "overlap" in their respective distributions, summed over all utterances (weighted by the likelihood of the utterance in the <em>discursive domain</em>).</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Discussions with <em>low coliteracy</em> can be found in Flat Earth-related groups on Facebook. Notably, scientific and mathematical literacy is required to stabilize the meanings of many of the terms involved.</p>
<p>Academic departments seek to structure themselves and their relationships with other universities, in order to certify that "graduates" should expect <em>high coliteracy</em> with similarly credentialed parties. </p>
<p>Social media tools such as tagging and search have enabled members of progressively niche subcultures to gravitate toward stable meanings and continuously negotiate their shared language.</p>
<p>Intersectional and so-called "culture war" discussions are thought to span the range of coliteracy.</p></main><hr><footer></footer></body></html>
