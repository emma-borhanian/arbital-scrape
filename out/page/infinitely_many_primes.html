<p>First, we note that there is indeed a prime: namely $~$2$~$.
We will also state a lemma: that every number greater than $~$1$~$ has a prime which divides it.
(This is the easier half of the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic.html">Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</a>, and the slightly stronger statement that "every number may be written as a product of primes" is proved there.)</p>
<p>Now we can proceed to the meat of the proof.
Suppose that there were finitely many prime numbers $~$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$~$.
Since we know $~$2$~$ is prime, we know $~$2$~$ appears in that list.</p>
<p>Then consider the number $~$P = p_1p_2\ldots p_n + 1$~$ — that is, the product of all primes plus 1.
Since $~$2$~$ appeared in the list, we know $~$P \geq 2+1 = 3$~$, and in particular $~$P &gt; 1$~$.</p>
<p>The number $~$P$~$ can't be divided by any of the primes in our list, because it's 1 more than a multiple of them.
But there is a prime which divides $~$P$~$, because $~$P&gt;1$~$; we stated this as a lemma.
This is immediately a contradiction: $~$P$~$ cannot be divided by any prime, even though all integers greater than $~$1$~$ can be divided by a prime.</p>
<h1 id="example">Example</h1>
<p>There is a common misconception that $~$p_1 p_2 \dots p_n+1$~$ must be prime if $~$p_1, \dots, p_n$~$ are all primes.
This isn't actually the case: if we let $~$p_1, \dots, p_6$~$ be the first six primes $~$2,3,5,7,11,13$~$, then you can check by hand that $~$p_1 \dots p_6 + 1 = 30031$~$; but $~$30031 = 59 \times 509$~$.
(These are all somewhat ad-hoc; there is no particular reason I knew that taking the first six primes would give me a composite number at the end.)
However, we <em>have</em> discovered a new prime this way (in fact, two new primes!): namely $~$59$~$ and $~$509$~$.</p>
<p>In general, this is a terrible way to discover new primes.
The proof tells us that there must be some new prime dividing $~$30031$~$, without telling us anything about what those primes are, or even if there is more than one of them (that is, it doesn't tell us whether $~$30031$~$ is prime or composite).
Without knowing in advance that $~$30031$~$ is equal to $~$59 \times 509$~$, it is in general very difficult to <em>discover</em> those two prime factors.
In fact, it's an open problem whether or not prime factorisation is "easy" in the specific technical sense of there being a polynomial-time algorithm to do it, though most people believe that prime factorisation is "hard" in this sense.</p></main><hr><section class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/EdwinEvans.html">Edwin Evans</a></p><p><p>How does this prove that P isn't divisible by any non-prime number?
