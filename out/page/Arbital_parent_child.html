We call these connections <em>relationships</em>. Parent-child relationship is one of the multiple relationship types and is the tightest way to connect pages on Arbital. This relationship is used to indicate that the child is a critical component of the parent, or that the parent is the sum of its children. For example, the [SI_units SI units] parent page will have [kilogram], [second], [meter], etc… as children pages.</p>
<p>It's perfectly fine for a page not to have any parents or children. It can still be found by searching, and can be used as a <a href="Arbital_tag.html">tag</a>, <a href="arbital_requisite.html">requisite</a>, or link.</p>
<h3 id="whentocreateaparentchildrelationship">When to create a parent-child relationship</h3>
<p>When the child doesn't make sense outside of the context of the parent. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 2 of "Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone" doesn't make a lot of sense by itself. So it's a child of "Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone (book)" page, which is itself a child of "Harry Potter (book series)" page.</li>
</ul>
<p>When there is some well-known, established hierarchy. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"C. lupus (species)", or commonly known as gray wolf, is a child of the "Canis (genus)" page, which is a child of "Canidae (family)" page, etc… This taxonomy of biological organisms is pretty well established.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the parent is defined as the sum of some parts. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic is addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by definition. So "Arithmetic" page will have those pages as children.</li>
</ul>
<p>More generally the parent-child relationship suggest a "is-a" or a "is-a-part-of" connetion. Sometimes it's also simply used for organizing pages in a hierarchy to make it easier to find them.</p>
<h3 id="whennottocreateaparentchildrelationships">When not to create a parent-child relationships</h3>
<p>Just because two concepts are often associated. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chlorophyll, an important biomolecule used for photosynthesis, is usually associated with plants. But not all plants have chlorophyll, and chlorophyll can occur outside of plants, e.g. in algae.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just because two concepts are closely related. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plants, chlorophyll, and photosynthesis are pretty closely related. But photosynthesis as a process can happen in things other than plants or using a mechanism that doesn't involve chlorophyll. And some plants don't even have chlorophyll.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it can be unclear if the pages should have a parent-child relationship. If you run into a case you can't clearly resolve, please post it here, so we can discuss it, learn from it, and refine these definitions.</p></main><hr><section class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/EricBruylant.html">Eric Bruylant</a></p><p><p>This gives a few clear examples, but does not help much with slightly less clear judgements (e.g. should <a href="NickBostrom.html">Nick Bostrom</a> be a child of <a href="people.html">People</a> or just tagged with it?). Classification systems are tricky and often subjective, probably worth taking a close look at Wikidata and other similar projects for inspiration when we want to work out detailed guidelines for this.</p></p></div></section><footer><p class="all-creators"><h2>All Creators</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/AlexeiAndreev.html">Alexei Andreev</a>,
