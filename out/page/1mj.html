<p>Suppose we say "2 + 1 = 1 + 2".  Since this is only a statement about three specific numbers, this statement would occupy the lowest level of the arithmetical hierarchy, which we can equivalently call $~$\Delta_0,$~$ $~$\Pi_0,$~$ or $~$\Sigma_0$~$ (the reason for using all three terms will soon become clear).</p>
<p>Next, suppose we say, "For all numbers x: (1 + x) = (x + 1)."  This generalizes over <em>all</em> numbers - a universal quantifier - and then makes a statement about each particular number x, that (1 + x) = (x + 1), that involves no further quantifiers and can be verified immediately.  This statement is said to be in $~$\Pi_1.$~$</p>
<p>Suppose we say, "There exists a y such that $~$y^9 = 9^y.$~$"  This is a single existential quantifier.  To verify it by sheer brute force, we'd need to start from 0 and then consider successive integers y, checking for each particular y whether it was true that $~$y^9 = 9^y.$~$  Since the statement has a single existential quantifier over y, surrounding a statement that for any particular y is in $~$\Delta_0,$~$ it is said to be in $~$\Sigma_1.$~$</p>
<p>Suppose we say, "For every number x, there exists a prime number y that is greater than x."  For any particular $~$c$~$ the statement "There is a prime number x that is greater than $~$c$~$" lies in $~$\Sigma_1.$~$  Universally quantifying over all $~$c,$~$ outside of the $~$\Sigma_1$~$ statement about any particular $~$c,$~$ creates a statement in $~$\Pi_2.$~$</p>
<p>Similarly, the statement "There exists a number x such that, for every number y, $~$(x + y) &gt; 10^9$~$ would be in $~$\Sigma_2,$~$ since it adjoins a "there exists a number x…" to a statement that lies in $~$\Pi_1$~$ for any particular $~$x.$~$</p>
<p>Generalizing, putting a "There exists an x…" quantifier outside a $~$\Pi_n$~$ statement creates a $~$\Sigma_{n+1}$~$ statement, and putting a "For all y" quantifier outside a $~$\Sigma_n$~$ statement about y creates a $~$\Pi_{n+1}$~$ statement.</p>
<p>If there are equivalent ways of formulating a sentence such that it can be seen to occupy both $~$\Sigma_n$~$ and $~$\Pi_n$~$, we say that it belongs to $~$\Delta_n.$~$  </p>
<h1 id="consequencesforepistemicreasoning">Consequences for epistemic reasoning</h1>
<p>Statements in $~$\Sigma_1$~$ are <em>verifiable</em>.  Taking "There exists $~$y$~$ such that $~$y^9 = 9^y$~$" as the example, soon as we find any one particular $~$y$~$ such that $~$y^9 = 9^y,$~$ we can verify the central formula $~$y^9 = 9^y$~$ for that particular $~$y$~$ immediately, and then we're done.</p>
<p>Statements in $~$\Pi_1$~$ are <em>falsifiable</em>.  We can decisively demonstrate them to be wrong by finding a particular example where the core statement is false. </p>
<p>Sentences in $~$\Delta_1$~$ are those which are both falsifiable and verifiable in finite time.</p>
<p>$~$\Pi_2$~$ and $~$\Sigma_2$~$ statements are not definitely verifiable or falsifiable by brute force.  E.g. for a $~$\Pi_2$~$ statement, "For every x there is a y", even after we've found a y for many particular x, we haven't tested all the x; and even if we've searched some particular x and not yet found any y, we haven't yet searched all possible y.  But statements in this class can still be probabilistically supported or countersupported by examples; each time we find an example of a y for another x, we might become a little more confident, and if for some x we fail to find a y after a long time searching, we might become a little less confident.</p>
<h1 id="subtleties">Subtleties</h1>
<h2 id="boundedquantifiersdontcount">Bounded quantifiers don't count</h2>
<p>The statement, "For every number $~$x,$~$ there exists a prime number $~$y$~$ smaller than $~$x^x$~$" is said to lie in $~$\Pi_1$~$, not $~$\Pi_2$~$.  Since the existence statement is bounded by $~$x^x$~$, a function which can itself be computed in bounded time, in principle we could just search through every possible $~$y$~$ that is less than $~$x^x$~$ and test it in bounded time.  For any particular $~$x,$~$ such as $~$x = 2,$~$ we could indeed replace the statement "There exists a prime number $~$y$~$ less than $~$2^2$~$" with the statement "Either 0 is a prime number, or 1 is a prime number, or 2 is a prime number, or 3 is a prime number" which contains no quantifiers at all.  Thus, in general within the arithmetical hierarchy, bounded quantifiers don't count.</p>
<p>We similarly observe that the statement  "For every number $~$x,$~$ there exists a prime number $~$y$~$ smaller than $~$x^x$~$" is <em>falsifiable</em> - we could falsify it by exhibiting some particular constant $~$c,$~$ testing all the numbers smaller than $~$c^c,$~$ and failing to find any primes.  (As would in fact be the case if we tested $~$c=1.$~$)</p>
<h2 id="similaradjacentquantifierscanbecollapsedintoasinglequantifier">Similar adjacent quantifiers can be collapsed into a single quantifier</h2>
<p>Since bounded quantifiers don't count, it follows more subtly that we can combine adjacent quantifiers of the same type, since there are bounded ways to <em>encode</em> multiple numbers in a single number.  For example, the numbers x and y can be encoded into a single number $~$z = 2^x \cdot 3^y$~$.  So if I want to say, "For every nonzero integers x, y, and z, it is not the case that $~$x^3 + y^3 = z^3$~$" I can actually just say, "There's no number $~$w$~$ such that there exist nonzero x, y, and z <em>less than w</em> with $~$w = 2^x \cdot 3^y \cdot 5^z$~$ and $~$x^3 + y^3 = z^3.$~$"  Thus, the three adjacent universal quantifiers over all x, y, and z can be combined.  However, if the sentence is "for all x there exists y", there's no way to translate that into a statement about a single number z, so only alike quantifiers can be collapsed in this way.</p>
<p>With these subtleties in hand, we can see, e.g., that Fermat's Last Theorem belongs in $~$\Pi_1,$~$ since FLT says, "For <em>every</em> w greater than 2 and x, y, z greater than 0, it's not the case that $~$x^w + y^w = z^w.$~$  This implies that like any other $~$\Pi_1$~$ statement, Fermat's Last Theorem should be falsifiable by brute force but not verifiable by brute force.  If a counterexample existed, we could eventually find it by brute force (even if it took longer than the age of the universe) and exhibit that example to decisively disprove FLT; but there's no amount of brute-force verification of particular examples that can prove the larger theorem.</p>
<h2 id="howimplicationsinteractwithfalsifiabilityandverifiability">How implications interact with falsifiability and verifiability</h2>
<p>In general, if the implication $~$X \rightarrow Y$~$ holds, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>If $~$Y$~$ is falsifiable, $~$X$~$ is falsifiable.</li>
<li>If $~$X$~$ is verifiable, $~$Y$~$ is verifiable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The converse implications do not hold.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the $~$\Pi_2$~$ statement "For every prime $~$x$~$, there is a larger prime $~$y$~$".  Ignoring the existence of proofs, this statement is unfalsifiable by direct observation.  The falsifiable $~$\Pi_1$~$ statement, "For every prime $~$x$~$, there is a larger prime $~$y = f(x) = 4x+1$~$ would if true imply the $~$\Pi_2$~$ statement."  But this doesn't make the $~$\Pi_2$~$ statement falsifiable.  Even if the $~$\Pi_1$~$ assertion about the primeness of $~$4x+1$~$ in particular is false, the $~$\Pi_2$~$ statement can still be true (as is indeed the case).  [comment:  Patrick, is there a particular reason we want this knowledge to be accessible to people who don't natively read logic?  I.e. were you making something else rely on it?]</p></main><hr><footer><p class="tagged"><h2>Tagged</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/c_class_meta_tag.html">C-Class</a>,
