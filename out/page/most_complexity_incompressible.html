<p>This takes on defensive importance with respect to refuting the probability-theoretic fallacy, "Oh, sure, Occam's Razor seems to say that this proposition is complicated.  But how can you be sure that this apparently complex proposition wouldn't turn out to be generated by some very simple mechanism?"  If we consider a <a href="exclusive_exhaustive.html">partition</a> of 10,000 possible propositions, collectively having a 0.01% probability on average, then all the arguments in the world for why various propositions might have unexpectedly high probability, must still add up to an average probability of 0.01%.  It can't be the case that after considering that proposition 1 might have secretly high probability, and considering that proposition 2 might have secretly high probability, and so on, we end up assigning 5% probability to each proposition, because that would be a total probability of 500.  If we assign prior probabilities using an algorithmic-complexity Occam prior as in <a href="solomonoff_induction.html">Solomonoff induction</a>, then the observation that "most apparently complex things can't be further compressed into an amazingly simple Turing machine", is the same observation as that "most apparently Occam-penalized propositions can't turn out to be simpler than they look" or "most apparently subjectively improbable things can't turn out to have unseen clever arguments that would validly make them more subjectively probable".</p></main><hr><section class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/EricRogstad.html">Eric Rogstad</a></p><p><blockquote class="comment-context">Although the halting problem means we can't prove it doesn't happen, it would nonetheless be extremely surprising if some 100\-state Turing machine turned out to print the exact text of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet\.

<p>Not 2^100?</p></p></div><div class="comment"><p><a class="page-link" href="../page/KayaFallenstein.html">Kaya Fallenstein</a></p><p><p>"Similarly, if you start with a 10 kilobyte text file, and 7zip compresses it down to 2 kilobytes, no amount of time spent trying to <strong>further</strong> compress the file using other compression programs will <strong>ever</strong> get that file down to 1 byte." (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p>This claim seems too strong. Do you mean that an arbitrary compression algorithm is unlikely to compress the file to one byte? </p>
<p>Taking what's written at face value, if I assume that every compression I apply monotonically decreases the size of the file, then I need only find a large enough sequence of compressions and compose them to compress my file to one byte. This is of course silly, since the composition is just a huge highly specialized compression program optimized for this instance, but I can spend enough time to make it happen.</p></p></div></section><footer><p class="tagged"><h2>Tagged</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/start_meta_tag.html">Start</a></span></p><p class="likes"><h2>Likes</h2><span class="page-comma-list"><a class="page-link" href="../page/EricBruylant.html">Eric Bruylant</a>,
