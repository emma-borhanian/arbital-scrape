<p>In the context of <a href="ai_alignment.html">AI alignment theory</a>, Cartesian agents are usually associated with optimizing for [cartesian_reward sensory rewards] - there's some particular component of the environment's input which is a "reward signal", or the agent is trying to optimize some directly computed function of sensory data.</p></main><hr><footer><p class="children"><h2>Children</h2><ul class="page-tree"><li><a class="page-link" href="../page/cartesian_boundary.html">Cartesian agent-environment boundary</a> <q>If your agent is separated from the environment by an absolute border that can only be crossed by sensory information and motor outputs, it might just be a Cartesian agent.</q> - <a class="page-link" href="../page/EliezerYudkowsky.html">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a></li></ul></p></footer></body></html>
